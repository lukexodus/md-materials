## What

This is a **collection of reading materials** in markdown format, focused on **programming** and **computer science** topics.

We belive that not every reading material we find is the same—some are short, some are long, some are incomplete, and some are comprehensive.

The goal of this collection is to provide reading materials that:

* Are comprehensive enough to ensure competence in the topic, while also offering depth for mastery and advanced understanding
* Help readers not only become familiar with a topic, but also gain a well-informed and practical grasp of it in the shortest possible time.

## Why

### Effectiveness through Knowledge

All of us want to be effective in our work. Effectiveness, however, is built on **knowledge** and **experience**. The faster we acquire knowledge, the sooner we can translate it into experience and competence.

### The Challenge in the IT Industry

In the IT industry, this need is even more pressing. Technology evolves at an accelerating pace—new tools, frameworks, and approaches emerge while older ones quickly become obsolete. To survive and thrive as a developer, one must **continuously learn** and adapt.

### The Constraint of Time

Time is a limited resource. If we are going to learn, we must do it in a way that is both **fast** and **efficient**. The method of learning matters as much as the content itself.

### Learning Approaches

There are many ways to absorb information—books, videos, articles, mentorship, hands-on experience. Each has its place and importance. But when the goal is to achieve competence in the shortest time possible, some approaches are more effective than others.

### Why Reading is Central

* Reading allows us to **process more information** at a faster rate than listening.
* Written materials can be structured and condensed to **deliver the maximum amount of knowledge in the minimum amount of time**.
* Not all resources are arranged this way—but when they are, they offer the fastest path to competence.

### The Goal

If you want to become effective quickly, you must learn quickly. And the way to do this is to focus on **reading materials that are comprehensive, well-structured, and designed to maximize learning efficiency**.

## How To Take Advantage of the Materials

### Start with the Syllabus

Each topic begins with a **syllabus**. By skimming it, you gain a quick overview of all the subtopics and concepts covered. This helps you see both the **big picture** and the **learning path** from fundamentals to advanced ideas.

### Structured Markdown Format

All documents are written in **markdown**, which ensures that the content is:

* **Chronologically arranged**: progressing naturally from foundational concepts to advanced topics
* **Structured with headers**: each header acts like a navigational link, allowing you to jump directly to the section you need

This structure makes the materials useful for both **systematic study** and **quick review**.

### Tools for Navigation

To get the most out of the materials, use a text opener/editor that:

* Can read markdown format
* Can navigate the document through its **outline** or **table of contents**

You can already do this directly in GitHub. Other excellent apps for this purpose include:

* **Obsidian** (the one I personally use)
* **Roam Research**
* **RemNote**
* **Workflowy**
* **Dynalist**
* **Notion** (limited outline support)
* Any markdown editor with outline navigation support

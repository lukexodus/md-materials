Find a real problem before you solve something.

You don't have to solve every problem by creating a new abstraction, because not every problem is worth solving.

Just because something isn't new or shiny doesn't mean it's not the most successful thing ever. - ThePrimeTime

The fierecest programmer is not the one who can type fast or the one who can think fast or the one who has extensive knowlege, though these are indispensable skills. The fiercest programmer is the one who can automate the usage and the application of his knowledge.

He is a wise delegator. He identifies all areas the computers are more superior than humans and so he delegates all of it to them.

He always thinks of all the processes he can automate, even the most trivial ones, because he knows that time and effort savings add up.

He is the DRYest programmer. He continuously maximizes his development time. He is continuously learning and is continuously discovering all the applications of his knowledge in the most efficient way.

**Don't start to code when you haven't planned all of it out.** 

Unless:
- You determine that it's safe to code and that you determine you will figure it out by coding.
- The only way to find out is to experiement.

**Plan first. Even if it will take a long time. Your experience building will be smooth as you have planned it all out.**

Seeing a lot of code at once is so daunting. But remember what you said once before, "It's not that complex, you just have to learn the necessary bits one by one, and all of it will make sense eventually."

It's the same feeling as looking at a text of another language, a paper filled with mathematical and chemical equations, and other 'esoteric'y things.

Just learn them bit by bit, them you will understand them like a wizard.

Therefore be patient and have grit when learning or relearning. It's part of growing as a developer you know: reviewing stuff, as necessary for all kinds of skills also.

Spaced repitition also applies in development. The more you repeat to learn how to build the app components, the more you will be better at building them. So don't be afraid or reluctant to review your code. Reviewing is your superpower, you know.

***

Never be afraid to change your code, if it is for the better. But you must be cautious when in production. Test it well first.

The best way have a grip again on your development when you haven't coded or touched your project for a while is to review your database structures and then just review all of your backend. 

It may be daunting at first, but it will become enjoyable.

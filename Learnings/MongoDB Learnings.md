With CRUD operations, you can only control the `projection` of immediate fields.

With `aggregate`, you can control the projection of nested fields using `$project`

I'm starting to categorize atomic operators into two: shy and assertive.

Those who come before the fields are `assertive`. And those who come after are `shy`.

Association helps memorization.

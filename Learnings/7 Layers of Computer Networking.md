The layers of computer networking, as defined by the OSI model, are organized from the lowest (most physical) to the highest (closest to the end user) level. Here are the layers from low to high:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: This is the lowest layer and deals with the physical transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium. It defines the electrical and mechanical specifications of the physical connections, such as voltages, pin layout, and cable specifications [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/).

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by the physical layer. It handles error detection and correction, as well as media access control (MAC) addressing [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: The network layer is responsible for structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing, and traffic control. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: This layer ensures reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network. It provides segmentation, acknowledgment, and multiplexing services. Examples of transport layer protocols include TCP and UDP [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/).

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: The session layer manages communication sessions, which are continuous exchanges of information between two nodes. It establishes, maintains, and terminates these sessions [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/osi-model-networking-layers-explained-in-plain-english/).

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: The presentation layer handles the translation of data between a networking service and an application. It performs tasks such as character encoding, data compression, encryption/decryption, and ensures that data is presented in a format understood by the application layer [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[5](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/the-7-osi-networking-layers-explained/).

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: This is the highest layer and is where network applications operate. It provides services to the applications and enables them to access the network. The application layer uses protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP to provide network services to the user [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/).

Each layer provides services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below. The OSI model is a theoretical framework used to understand how different network protocols interact and build upon each other to create network services.

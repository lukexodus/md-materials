`reset` removes commits. `revert` just goes back but just adds another commit, does not remove commits.

***

When a commit has unfinished feature or code changes, label it with `unstable`. So that it will not be used when rewinding.

***

When setting the remote origin, use the ssh form of the url, not the https one.

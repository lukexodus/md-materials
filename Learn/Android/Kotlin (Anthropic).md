### Creating Your First Hello World Program

### Simple Console Application

Create a file named `Main.kt`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin World!")
    
    // Demonstrating basic Kotlin features
    val name = "Kotlin"
    val version = 1.9
    
    println("Welcome to $name $version")
    
    // Showing null safety
    val nullableString: String? = null
    println("Nullable string length: ${nullableString?.length ?: "null"}")
    
    // Basic function call
    greetUser("Developer")
}

fun greetUser(userName: String) {
    println("Hello, $userName! Ready to learn Kotlin?")
}
```

### Interactive Hello World

Create an interactive version that demonstrates input handling:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("=== Welcome to Kotlin ===")
    
    print("Enter your name: ")
    val name = readLine() ?: "Anonymous"
    
    print("Enter your programming experience (years): ")
    val experienceInput = readLine()
    val experience = experienceInput?.toIntOrNull() ?: 0
    
    val message = when {
        experience == 0 -> "Welcome to programming, $name!"
        experience < 2 -> "Great start, $name! Kotlin is perfect for beginners."
        experience < 5 -> "Nice experience, $name! Kotlin will boost your productivity."
        else -> "Impressive experience, $name! Kotlin will feel familiar yet refreshing."
    }
    
    println(message)
    println("Let's start your Kotlin journey!")
}
```

### Building and Running

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

**Running the Program:**

- Right-click on the `main` function
- Select "Run 'MainKt'"
- View output in the integrated console
- Use the debug mode to step through code

**Building the Project:**

- Use Build > Build Project to compile
- Generate JAR files through Build > Build Artifacts
- Configure run configurations for different execution scenarios

### Command Line Compilation

**Compiling Kotlin Files:**

```bash
kotlinc Main.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar
java -jar hello.jar
```

**Alternative Direct Execution:**

```bash
kotlinc -script Main.kts
```

### Gradle Build

**Running with Gradle:**

```bash
gradle run
```

**Building Distribution:**

```bash
gradle build
gradle installDist
```

### Environment Verification

### Testing Your Setup

Create a comprehensive test file to verify all components:

```kotlin
import kotlin.system.getTimeMillis

fun main() {
    println("=== Kotlin Environment Verification ===\n")
    
    // Test basic language features
    testBasicFeatures()
    
    // Test null safety
    testNullSafety()
    
    // Test functional programming
    testFunctionalFeatures()
    
    // Test coroutines (basic)
    testBasicAsync()
    
    println("\n=== Environment Setup Complete! ===")
}

fun testBasicFeatures() {
    println("1. Basic Features Test:")
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
    println("   Original: $numbers")
    println("   Doubled: $doubled")
    println("   ✓ Collections and lambdas working")
}

fun testNullSafety() {
    println("\n2. Null Safety Test:")
    val nullableValue: String? = null
    val result = nullableValue?.length ?: "null"
    println("   Nullable handling: $result")
    println("   ✓ Null safety working")
}

fun testFunctionalFeatures() {
    println("\n3. Functional Programming Test:")
    val result = (1..5)
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .map { it * it }
        .sum()
    println("   Sum of squares of even numbers (1-5): $result")
    println("   ✓ Functional programming working")
}

fun testBasicAsync() {
    println("\n4. Basic Async Test:")
    val startTime = getTimeMillis()
    Thread.sleep(100) // Simulate work
    val endTime = getTimeMillis()
    println("   Execution time: ${endTime - startTime}ms")
    println("   ✓ Basic timing functions working")
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Choose the IDE that matches your target platform (IntelliJ for general development, Android Studio for Android apps)
- Understand the different Kotlin targets and their use cases before starting development
- Always verify your environment setup with a test program before beginning serious development
- Keep your Kotlin version updated to access the latest features and improvements

**Next Steps:** After completing environment setup, familiarize yourself with your chosen IDE's debugging tools, learn about Kotlin's build systems (Gradle/Maven), and explore the official Kotlin documentation and samples for your target platform.

## Kotlin Basic Syntax

### Variables and Constants

Kotlin provides two keywords for declaring variables: `var` for mutable variables and `val` for immutable values (constants).

```kotlin
// Mutable variable
var name = "John"
name = "Jane" // This is allowed

// Immutable value (constant)
val age = 25
// age = 26 // This would cause a compilation error
```

**Key points:**

- Use `val` by default for immutability and thread safety
- Use `var` only when you need to reassign the variable
- `val` references are immutable, but the objects they point to can still be modified
- Late initialization is possible with `lateinit var` for non-null properties

### Data Types

Kotlin has a rich type system with both primitive and reference types that are unified under the hood.

#### Numeric Types

```kotlin
val byte: Byte = 127
val short: Short = 32767
val int: Int = 2147483647
val long: Long = 9223372036854775807L
val float: Float = 3.14f
val double: Double = 3.141592653589793
```

#### Character and Boolean Types

```kotlin
val char: Char = 'A'
val boolean: Boolean = true
```

#### String Type

```kotlin
val text: String = "Hello, Kotlin!"
val multilineText = """
    This is a
    multiline string
    with proper indentation
""".trimIndent()
```

#### Collections

```kotlin
val list = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val mutableList = mutableListOf("a", "b", "c")
val map = mapOf("key1" to "value1", "key2" to "value2")
val set = setOf(1, 2, 3, 2) // Will contain [1, 2, 3]
```

**Key points:**

- All types in Kotlin are objects - no primitive types at the language level
- Numbers are automatically boxed when needed
- Use appropriate suffixes: `L` for Long, `f` for Float
- Collections are immutable by default; use mutable versions when needed

### Type Inference and Explicit Typing

Kotlin's compiler can infer types in most cases, reducing boilerplate code while maintaining type safety.

```kotlin
// Type inference
val inferredInt = 42 // Inferred as Int
val inferredString = "Hello" // Inferred as String
val inferredList = listOf(1, 2, 3) // Inferred as List<Int>

// Explicit typing
val explicitInt: Int = 42
val explicitString: String = "Hello"
val explicitList: List<Int> = listOf(1, 2, 3)

// When explicit typing is necessary
val nullableString: String? = null
val emptyList: List<String> = emptyList()
```

#### Advanced Type Scenarios

```kotlin
// Generic type inference
val map = mapOf("a" to 1, "b" to 2) // Inferred as Map<String, Int>

// Lambda with inferred parameter types
val doubled = listOf(1, 2, 3).map { it * 2 } // 'it' is inferred as Int

// When compiler needs help
val result: Any = if (condition) "string" else 42
```

**Key points:**

- Kotlin's type inference is sophisticated and handles most scenarios
- Explicit typing improves readability in complex scenarios
- Use explicit typing for public APIs and when type isn't obvious
- Nullable types must be explicitly declared with `?`

### Comments and Documentation

Kotlin supports both single-line and multi-line comments, plus KDoc for documentation.

```kotlin
// Single-line comment
val x = 10 // End-of-line comment

/*
 * Multi-line comment
 * spanning multiple lines
 */
val y = 20

/**
 * KDoc documentation comment
 * 
 * This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * 
 * @param a The first number
 * @param b The second number
 * @return The sum of a and b
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either parameter is negative
 * @since 1.0
 * @author Your Name
 */
fun calculateSum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    require(a >= 0 && b >= 0) { "Parameters must be non-negative" }
    return a + b
}
```

#### Documentation Tags

```kotlin
/**
 * @param parameter description
 * @return return value description
 * @throws ExceptionType when this exception is thrown
 * @see RelatedClass
 * @since version
 * @author author name
 * @deprecated deprecation message
 * @sample fully.qualified.name.of.sample.function
 */
```

**Key points:**

- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments
- Use `/** */` for KDoc documentation
- KDoc supports Markdown formatting
- Good documentation improves code maintainability

### String Templates and Interpolation

Kotlin provides powerful string templating capabilities for embedding expressions within strings.

#### Basic String Templates

```kotlin
val name = "Alice"
val age = 30

// Simple variable interpolation
val greeting = "Hello, $name!"
val info = "Name: $name, Age: $age"

// Expression interpolation
val calculation = "The result is ${10 + 5}"
val comparison = "Is adult: ${age >= 18}"
```

#### Advanced String Templates

```kotlin
// Property access
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
val person = Person("Bob", 25)
val description = "Person: ${person.name} is ${person.age} years old"

// Function calls
fun getCurrentTime() = System.currentTimeMillis()
val timestamp = "Current time: ${getCurrentTime()}"

// Complex expressions
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val summary = "Numbers: ${numbers.joinToString(", ")}, Sum: ${numbers.sum()}"
```

#### Raw Strings and Escaping

```kotlin
// Raw strings with triple quotes
val jsonTemplate = """
    {
        "name": "$name",
        "age": $age,
        "active": ${true}
    }
""".trimIndent()

// Escaping in regular strings
val withQuotes = "He said: \"Hello, $name!\""
val withSpecialChars = "Path: C:\\Users\\$name\\Documents"

// Dollar sign escaping
val price = "Price: \$${19.99}"
```

#### String Template Best Practices

```kotlin
// Use curly braces for complex expressions
val result = "${if (score >= 90) "A" else "B"}"

// Format numbers
val formatted = "Score: ${"%.2f".format(85.678)}"

// Multi-line templates
val email = """
    Dear $name,
    
    Your account balance is $${balance}.
    
    Best regards,
    The Team
""".trimIndent()
```

**Key points:**

- Use `$variable` for simple variable interpolation
- Use `${expression}` for complex expressions
- Raw strings with `"""` preserve formatting and don't require escaping
- String templates are evaluated at runtime
- Use `trimIndent()` to remove common leading whitespace from multi-line strings

**Example:**

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val user = "Developer"
    val tasks = listOf("coding", "testing", "documentation")
    val progress = 75.5
    
    val report = """
        Daily Report for $user
        =====================
        
        Tasks completed: ${tasks.joinToString(", ")}
        Progress: ${progress}%
        Status: ${if (progress >= 80) "Excellent" else "Good"}
        
        Generated at: ${System.currentTimeMillis()}
    """.trimIndent()
    
    println(report)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Daily Report for Developer
=====================

Tasks completed: coding, testing, documentation
Progress: 75.5%
Status: Good

Generated at: 1703123456789
```

These fundamental syntax elements form the foundation of Kotlin programming, enabling you to write clean, expressive, and type-safe code. Understanding these basics is essential before moving on to more advanced Kotlin features like functions, classes, and coroutines.

## Basic Operations

### Arithmetic Operators

Kotlin supports standard arithmetic operators with both infix and function call syntax. The operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` work on numeric types including Int, Long, Float, and Double.

```kotlin
val a = 10
val b = 3
val sum = a + b        // 13
val difference = a - b // 7
val product = a * b    // 30
val quotient = a / b   // 3 (integer division)
val remainder = a % b  // 1
```

**Key points:**

- Integer division truncates decimal portions
- Use floating-point types for precise division
- Operators are translated to function calls (`a + b` becomes `a.plus(b)`)
- Unary operators include `+`, `-`, `++`, `--`

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators return Boolean values and include equality (`==`, `!=`) and relational (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) operators.

```kotlin
val x = 5
val y = 10
val isEqual = x == y        // false
val isNotEqual = x != y     // true
val isLess = x < y          // true
val isGreaterEqual = x >= y // false
```

**Key points:**

- `==` checks structural equality (calls `equals()`)
- `===` checks referential equality (same object instance)
- `!=` and `!==` are negations of equality operators
- Comparison operators can be overloaded for custom classes

### Logical Operators

Logical operators work with Boolean values and include AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

```kotlin
val condition1 = true
val condition2 = false
val andResult = condition1 && condition2  // false
val orResult = condition1 || condition2   // true
val notResult = !condition1               // false
```

**Key points:**

- `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting operators
- `and`, `or`, and `xor` are infix functions for Boolean operations
- Logical operators have precedence: `!` > `&&` > `||`

### Null Safety Basics

Kotlin's null safety system prevents null pointer exceptions at compile time through nullable and non-nullable types.

#### Safe Call Operator (`?.`)

The safe call operator allows safe access to properties and methods on nullable objects.

```kotlin
val name: String? = null
val length = name?.length  // Returns null instead of throwing exception
val upperCase = name?.uppercase()  // Chain safe calls
```

#### Not-Null Assertion Operator (`!!`)

The not-null assertion operator converts nullable types to non-nullable types but throws an exception if the value is null.

```kotlin
val name: String? = "Kotlin"
val length = name!!.length  // 6, but throws KotlinNullPointerException if name is null
```

#### Elvis Operator (`?:`)

The Elvis operator provides default values for null cases.

```kotlin
val name: String? = null
val displayName = name ?: "Unknown"  // "Unknown"
val length = name?.length ?: 0       // 0
```

**Key points:**

- Nullable types are declared with `?` suffix
- Safe calls return null if the receiver is null
- Use `!!` only when absolutely certain the value is not null
- Elvis operator enables concise null handling

### Basic Input/Output Operations

#### Standard Output

Kotlin provides several functions for console output.

```kotlin
print("Hello ")           // No newline
println("World!")         // With newline
printf("Number: %d", 42)  // Formatted output
```

#### Standard Input

Input operations typically use `readLine()` for console input.

```kotlin
print("Enter your name: ")
val name = readLine()  // Returns String? (nullable)
val safeName = readLine() ?: "Unknown"

print("Enter a number: ")
val number = readLine()?.toIntOrNull() ?: 0
```

#### File Operations

Basic file I/O operations for reading and writing files.

```kotlin
import java.io.File

// Reading files
val content = File("input.txt").readText()
val lines = File("input.txt").readLines()

// Writing files
File("output.txt").writeText("Hello, Kotlin!")
File("output.txt").appendText("\nNew line")
```

**Key points:**

- `readLine()` returns nullable String
- Always handle potential null values from input
- Use conversion functions with null safety (`toIntOrNull()`)
- File operations may throw exceptions - consider try-catch blocks

### Type Checking and Casting

#### Type Checking (`is`)

The `is` operator checks if an object is of a specific type.

```kotlin
fun processValue(value: Any) {
    if (value is String) {
        println("String length: ${value.length}")  // Smart cast
    }
    if (value is Int) {
        println("Integer value: $value")
    }
}
```

#### Type Casting (`as`)

The `as` operator performs explicit type casting.

```kotlin
val obj: Any = "Hello"
val str = obj as String        // Unsafe cast - throws exception if wrong type
val safeStr = obj as? String   // Safe cast - returns null if wrong type
```

#### Smart Casting

Kotlin automatically casts types after successful type checks.

```kotlin
fun handleValue(value: Any?) {
    if (value != null && value is String) {
        // value is automatically cast to String
        println(value.uppercase())
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- `is` enables type checking and triggers smart casting
- `as` performs explicit casting but may throw `ClassCastException`
- `as?` provides safe casting, returning null on failure
- Smart casting eliminates need for explicit casting after type checks

### Operator Overloading

Kotlin allows custom classes to define operator behavior through specific function names.

```kotlin
data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
    operator fun plus(other: Point) = Point(x + other.x, y + other.y)
    operator fun minus(other: Point) = Point(x - other.x, y - other.y)
}

val p1 = Point(1, 2)
val p2 = Point(3, 4)
val sum = p1 + p2  // Point(4, 6)
```

**Key points:**

- Operator functions must be marked with `operator` keyword
- Each operator maps to a specific function name
- Operators can be overloaded for custom behavior
- Maintains readability while providing mathematical syntax

### Range Operations

Kotlin provides range operators for creating sequences of values.

```kotlin
val range1 = 1..10        // 1 to 10 inclusive
val range2 = 1 until 10   // 1 to 9 (exclusive end)
val range3 = 10 downTo 1  // 10 to 1 descending
val range4 = 1..10 step 2 // 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

// Range checks
val number = 5
if (number in 1..10) {
    println("Number is in range")
}
```

**Key points:**

- `..` creates inclusive ranges
- `until` creates ranges with exclusive end
- `downTo` creates descending ranges
- `step` modifies range increment
- `in` operator checks range membership

**Related topics:** Functions and lambdas, collections operations, string manipulation, exception handling, and control flow statements build upon these basic operations.

# Control Flow and Functions

## Control Structures

### If Expressions

Kotlin's `if` is an expression that returns a value, not just a statement for control flow. This makes code more concise and functional in style.

```kotlin
// Basic if expression
val result = if (condition) "true branch" else "false branch"

// Multi-line if expression
val max = if (a > b) {
    println("Choose a")
    a
} else {
    println("Choose b")
    b
}

// If without else (returns Unit)
if (score > 90) println("Excellent!")

// Nested if expressions
val grade = if (score >= 90) "A"
            else if (score >= 80) "B"
            else if (score >= 70) "C"
            else "F"
```

**Key points:**

- `if` expressions must have an `else` branch when used as expressions
- The last expression in each branch becomes the return value
- Can be used anywhere an expression is expected
- Type inference works with if expressions

### When Expressions

The `when` expression is Kotlin's pattern matching construct, more powerful than traditional switch statements.

```kotlin
// Basic when expression
val description = when (x) {
    1 -> "One"
    2 -> "Two"
    3, 4 -> "Three or Four"
    in 5..10 -> "Between 5 and 10"
    else -> "Something else"
}

// When with arbitrary expressions
when {
    x.isOdd() -> print("x is odd")
    x.isEven() -> print("x is even")
    else -> print("x is funny")
}

// When with type checking
when (obj) {
    is String -> println("String of length ${obj.length}")
    is Int -> println("Integer value: $obj")
    is List<*> -> println("List with ${obj.size} elements")
    else -> println("Unknown type")
}

// When with ranges and collections
when (x) {
    in 1..10 -> println("x is in the range")
    in validNumbers -> println("x is valid")
    !in 10..20 -> println("x is outside the range")
    else -> println("none of the above")
}

// When without argument
when {
    x > 0 -> println("positive")
    x < 0 -> println("negative")
    else -> println("zero")
}
```

**Key points:**

- `when` expressions are exhaustive - all possible cases must be covered
- Can match values, ranges, types, and arbitrary conditions
- Multiple conditions can be combined with commas
- Smart casting occurs automatically in type-checked branches
- Can be used as statements or expressions

### For Loops and Ranges

Kotlin's `for` loops work with any iterable and provide powerful range operations.

```kotlin
// Basic for loop with range
for (i in 1..5) {
    println(i) // prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}

// For loop with until (exclusive end)
for (i in 1 until 5) {
    println(i) // prints 1, 2, 3, 4
}

// For loop with step
for (i in 1..10 step 2) {
    println(i) // prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
}

// Downward for loop
for (i in 5 downTo 1) {
    println(i) // prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
}

// For loop with collections
val items = listOf("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for (item in items) {
    println(item)
}

// For loop with indices
for (i in items.indices) {
    println("$i: ${items[i]}")
}

// For loop with index and value
for ((index, value) in items.withIndex()) {
    println("$index: $value")
}

// For loop with maps
val map = mapOf("a" to 1, "b" to 2, "c" to 3)
for ((key, value) in map) {
    println("$key -> $value")
}

// Custom progressions
for (i in 2..10 step 2) {
    println(i) // prints 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
}
```

**Key points:**

- Ranges are inclusive by default (`..`) or exclusive with `until`
- `step` allows custom increments
- `downTo` creates descending ranges
- `indices` property provides valid index range for collections
- `withIndex()` returns index-value pairs
- Destructuring works in for loops

### While and Do-While Loops

Traditional loop constructs for condition-based iteration.

```kotlin
// While loop
var i = 0
while (i < 5) {
    println(i)
    i++
}

// Do-while loop (executes at least once)
var j = 0
do {
    println(j)
    j++
} while (j < 3)

// While with complex conditions
var input: String?
while (readLine().also { input = it } != "quit") {
    println("You entered: $input")
}

// Infinite loops with break
while (true) {
    val line = readLine() ?: break
    if (line.isEmpty()) break
    processLine(line)
}
```

**Key points:**

- `while` checks condition before execution
- `do-while` executes body at least once
- Can use complex conditions and assignments
- Often used with `break` for controlled termination

### Break and Continue with Labels

Kotlin supports labeled breaks and continues for controlling nested loop execution.

```kotlin
// Basic break and continue
for (i in 1..10) {
    if (i == 5) continue // skip 5
    if (i == 8) break    // stop at 8
    println(i)
}

// Labeled break in nested loops
outer@ for (i in 1..3) {
    inner@ for (j in 1..3) {
        if (i == 2 && j == 2) break@outer
        println("$i, $j")
    }
}

// Labeled continue
loop@ for (i in 1..5) {
    for (j in 1..3) {
        if (j == 2) continue@loop
        println("$i, $j")
    }
}

// Labels with when expressions
fun processNumbers(numbers: List<Int>) {
    processing@ for (num in numbers) {
        when {
            num < 0 -> continue@processing
            num == 0 -> break@processing
            num > 100 -> {
                println("Large number: $num")
                continue@processing
            }
            else -> println("Processing: $num")
        }
    }
}

// Labels with forEach
numbers.forEach lit@{ number ->
    if (number < 0) return@lit // continue to next iteration
    if (number == 0) return    // return from enclosing function
    println(number)
}
```

**Key points:**

- Labels are defined with `@` syntax
- `break@label` exits the labeled loop
- `continue@label` continues with next iteration of labeled loop
- Labels work with any expression, not just loops
- `return@label` in lambda expressions returns from the labeled scope

### Advanced Control Flow Patterns

```kotlin
// Elvis operator with control flow
val name = getName() ?: return "No name provided"

// Let with control flow
user?.let { u ->
    if (u.isValid()) {
        processUser(u)
    } else {
        return "Invalid user"
    }
}

// When with sealed classes
sealed class Result
object Success : Result()
data class Error(val message: String) : Result()

fun handleResult(result: Result) = when (result) {
    is Success -> println("Success!")
    is Error -> println("Error: ${result.message}")
}

// Try-catch as expression
val result = try {
    riskyOperation()
} catch (e: Exception) {
    "Error: ${e.message}"
}
```

**Key points:**

- Control structures integrate with Kotlin's null safety
- Sealed classes work excellently with `when` expressions
- Exception handling can be used as expressions
- Scope functions provide additional control flow options

### Performance Considerations

```kotlin
// Prefer when over multiple if-else for performance
// Good
when (value) {
    1 -> action1()
    2 -> action2()
    3 -> action3()
    else -> defaultAction()
}

// Less efficient for many conditions
if (value == 1) action1()
else if (value == 2) action2()
else if (value == 3) action3()
else defaultAction()

// Use ranges efficiently
val isValid = x in 1..100 // More efficient than x >= 1 && x <= 100

// Avoid creating unnecessary objects in loops
// Bad
for (i in 1..1000) {
    val list = mutableListOf<String>() // Creates new list each iteration
    // ...
}

// Good
val list = mutableListOf<String>()
for (i in 1..1000) {
    list.clear()
    // ...
}
```

**Key points:**

- `when` expressions are optimized for multiple conditions
- Range checks are optimized internally
- Avoid object creation in tight loops
- Consider using sequence operations for large datasets

## Functions

### Function Declaration and Syntax

Functions in Kotlin are declared using the `fun` keyword and follow a specific syntax pattern that emphasizes clarity and type safety.

### Basic Function Syntax

The fundamental structure of a Kotlin function includes the function keyword, name, parameters, return type, and body:

```kotlin
fun functionName(parameter1: Type1, parameter2: Type2): ReturnType {
    // function body
    return value
}
```

### Function Examples

```kotlin
// Simple function with no parameters
fun greetWorld(): String {
    return "Hello, World!"
}

// Function with parameters
fun addNumbers(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

// Function with multiple parameters of different types
fun createUserProfile(name: String, age: Int, isActive: Boolean): String {
    return "User: $name, Age: $age, Active: $isActive"
}

// Function with no return value (Unit type)
fun printMessage(message: String): Unit {
    println(message)
}

// Unit return type can be omitted
fun printMessage2(message: String) {
    println(message)
}
```

### Function Visibility Modifiers

Functions can have different visibility levels:

```kotlin
// Public function (default)
fun publicFunction() {
    println("Accessible from anywhere")
}

// Private function
private fun privateFunction() {
    println("Only accessible within the same file/class")
}

// Internal function
internal fun internalFunction() {
    println("Accessible within the same module")
}

// Protected function (only in classes)
protected fun protectedFunction() {
    println("Accessible within class and subclasses")
}
```

### Parameters and Return Types

### Parameter Types and Declarations

Kotlin functions require explicit type declarations for parameters, ensuring type safety at compile time:

```kotlin
// Basic parameter types
fun processData(
    text: String,
    number: Int,
    decimal: Double,
    flag: Boolean
): String {
    return "Processing: $text, $number, $decimal, $flag"
}

// Nullable parameters
fun handleOptionalData(data: String?): String {
    return data ?: "No data provided"
}

// Function type parameters
fun executeOperation(operation: (Int, Int) -> Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}
```

### Return Types

Functions can return various types, including complex objects and nullable types:

```kotlin
// Returning primitive types
fun calculateArea(length: Double, width: Double): Double {
    return length * width
}

// Returning nullable types
fun findUserById(id: Int): User? {
    return if (id > 0) User(id, "John") else null
}

// Returning collections
fun getEvenNumbers(numbers: List<Int>): List<Int> {
    return numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
}

// Returning custom objects
data class Result(val success: Boolean, val message: String)

fun validateInput(input: String): Result {
    return if (input.isNotBlank()) {
        Result(true, "Valid input")
    } else {
        Result(false, "Input cannot be empty")
    }
}
```

### Generic Functions

Functions can work with generic types for increased flexibility:

```kotlin
fun <T> findFirst(items: List<T>, predicate: (T) -> Boolean): T? {
    return items.firstOrNull(predicate)
}

fun <T, R> transform(input: T, transformer: (T) -> R): R {
    return transformer(input)
}
```

### Default Parameters and Named Arguments

### Default Parameters

Kotlin allows functions to have default parameter values, reducing the need for function overloading:

```kotlin
// Function with default parameters
fun createConnection(
    host: String = "localhost",
    port: Int = 8080,
    timeout: Int = 30000,
    useSSL: Boolean = false
): String {
    return "Connecting to $host:$port (SSL: $useSSL, Timeout: ${timeout}ms)"
}

// Usage examples
fun demonstrateDefaultParameters() {
    // Using all defaults
    println(createConnection())
    
    // Overriding some parameters
    println(createConnection("example.com"))
    
    // Overriding multiple parameters
    println(createConnection("example.com", 443, useSSL = true))
}
```

### Complex Default Parameters

Default parameters can be expressions and can reference other parameters:

```kotlin
fun generateReport(
    title: String,
    author: String = "Anonymous",
    timestamp: Long = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    format: String = "PDF",
    includeCharts: Boolean = format == "PDF"
): String {
    return "Report: $title by $author at $timestamp (Format: $format, Charts: $includeCharts)"
}

// Default parameters with collections
fun processItems(
    items: List<String>,
    separator: String = ", ",
    prefix: String = "[",
    suffix: String = "]",
    transform: (String) -> String = { it.uppercase() }
): String {
    return items.joinToString(separator, prefix, suffix, transform = transform)
}
```

### Named Arguments

Named arguments allow you to specify parameter values by name, improving code readability:

```kotlin
fun sendEmail(
    to: String,
    subject: String,
    body: String,
    cc: String? = null,
    bcc: String? = null,
    priority: String = "normal"
) {
    println("Sending email to $to with subject '$subject'")
}

fun demonstrateNamedArguments() {
    // Using named arguments for clarity
    sendEmail(
        to = "user@example.com",
        subject = "Important Update",
        body = "Please review the attached document",
        priority = "high"
    )
    
    // Mixed positional and named arguments
    sendEmail(
        "user@example.com",
        "Quick Question",
        body = "Can you help with this?",
        cc = "manager@example.com"
    )
}
```

### Single-Expression Functions

When a function returns a single expression, you can use the simplified syntax with the equals sign:

```kotlin
// Traditional function syntax
fun addTraditional(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

// Single-expression function
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b

// Type inference with single-expression functions
fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b

// More complex single-expression functions
fun isEven(number: Int) = number % 2 == 0

fun getGreeting(name: String) = "Hello, $name!"

fun calculateDiscount(price: Double, percentage: Double) = price * (percentage / 100)
```

### Advanced Single-Expression Functions

Single-expression functions work well with functional programming concepts:

```kotlin
// Using when expression
fun getGrade(score: Int) = when {
    score >= 90 -> "A"
    score >= 80 -> "B"
    score >= 70 -> "C"
    score >= 60 -> "D"
    else -> "F"
}

// Using collection operations
fun getActiveUsers(users: List<User>) = users.filter { it.isActive }

fun getTotalPrice(items: List<Item>) = items.sumOf { it.price }

// Using let for null safety
fun processString(input: String?) = input?.let { it.trim().uppercase() } ?: "EMPTY"
```

### Local Functions and Scope

Local functions are functions defined inside other functions, providing encapsulation and code organization:

```kotlin
fun processUserData(userData: String): String {
    // Local function for validation
    fun isValidEmail(email: String): Boolean {
        return email.contains("@") && email.contains(".")
    }
    
    // Local function for formatting
    fun formatName(name: String): String {
        return name.trim().split(" ").joinToString(" ") { 
            it.lowercase().replaceFirstChar { char -> char.uppercase() }
        }
    }
    
    val parts = userData.split("|")
    if (parts.size != 2) return "Invalid format"
    
    val name = formatName(parts[0])
    val email = parts[1].trim()
    
    return if (isValidEmail(email)) {
        "User: $name, Email: $email"
    } else {
        "Invalid email format"
    }
}
```

### Local Functions with Closure

Local functions can access variables from their enclosing scope:

```kotlin
fun createCounter(initialValue: Int): () -> Int {
    var count = initialValue
    
    // Local function that captures the count variable
    fun increment(): Int {
        count++
        return count
    }
    
    return ::increment
}

fun demonstrateClosures() {
    val counter1 = createCounter(0)
    val counter2 = createCounter(100)
    
    println(counter1()) // 1
    println(counter1()) // 2
    println(counter2()) // 101
    println(counter1()) // 3
}
```

### Complex Local Function Example

```kotlin
fun analyzeText(text: String): Map<String, Any> {
    // Local function for word counting
    fun countWords(input: String): Int {
        return input.trim().split("\\s+".toRegex()).size
    }
    
    // Local function for character analysis
    fun analyzeCharacters(input: String): Map<String, Int> {
        var letters = 0
        var digits = 0
        var spaces = 0
        var others = 0
        
        for (char in input) {
            when {
                char.isLetter() -> letters++
                char.isDigit() -> digits++
                char.isWhitespace() -> spaces++
                else -> others++
            }
        }
        
        return mapOf(
            "letters" to letters,
            "digits" to digits,
            "spaces" to spaces,
            "others" to others
        )
    }
    
    // Local function for readability score
    fun calculateReadabilityScore(wordCount: Int, charCount: Int): Double {
        return if (wordCount > 0) charCount.toDouble() / wordCount else 0.0
    }
    
    val wordCount = countWords(text)
    val charAnalysis = analyzeCharacters(text)
    val readabilityScore = calculateReadabilityScore(wordCount, text.length)
    
    return mapOf(
        "wordCount" to wordCount,
        "characterAnalysis" to charAnalysis,
        "readabilityScore" to readabilityScore,
        "length" to text.length
    )
}
```

### Extension Functions Introduction

Extension functions allow you to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code:

```kotlin
// Basic extension function
fun String.removeSpaces(): String {
    return this.replace(" ", "")
}

// Extension function with parameters
fun String.truncate(maxLength: Int): String {
    return if (this.length <= maxLength) this else this.substring(0, maxLength) + "..."
}

// Extension function for collections
fun List<Int>.sum(): Int {
    var total = 0
    for (item in this) {
        total += item
    }
    return total
}

// Usage examples
fun demonstrateExtensions() {
    val text = "Hello World"
    println(text.removeSpaces()) // "HelloWorld"
    println(text.truncate(5)) // "Hello..."
    
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    println(numbers.sum()) // 15
}
```

### Advanced Extension Functions

Extension functions can be more complex and work with generic types:

```kotlin
// Generic extension function
fun <T> List<T>.secondOrNull(): T? {
    return if (this.size >= 2) this[1] else null
}

// Extension function with receiver type
fun String.isValidEmail(): Boolean {
    val emailPattern = "^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$"
    return this.matches(emailPattern.toRegex())
}

// Extension function for custom classes
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

fun Person.isAdult(): Boolean = this.age >= 18

fun Person.getAgeGroup(): String = when {
    age < 13 -> "Child"
    age < 20 -> "Teenager"
    age < 60 -> "Adult"
    else -> "Senior"
}
```

### Extension Functions with Scope

Extension functions can access only public members of the class they extend:

```kotlin
class BankAccount(private val balance: Double) {
    fun getBalance(): Double = balance
    
    fun deposit(amount: Double): BankAccount {
        return BankAccount(balance + amount)
    }
}

// Extension function - can only access public members
fun BankAccount.canAfford(amount: Double): Boolean {
    return this.getBalance() >= amount // Must use public getter
}

// Extension function with complex logic
fun BankAccount.getAccountStatus(): String {
    val balance = this.getBalance()
    return when {
        balance <= 0 -> "Overdrawn"
        balance < 100 -> "Low Balance"
        balance < 1000 -> "Normal"
        else -> "High Balance"
    }
}
```

### Nullable Receiver Extensions

Extension functions can be defined for nullable types:

```kotlin
fun String?.isNullOrEmpty(): Boolean {
    return this == null || this.isEmpty()
}

fun String?.orDefault(default: String): String {
    return this ?: default
}

// Usage
fun demonstrateNullableExtensions() {
    val nullString: String? = null
    val emptyString = ""
    val validString = "Hello"
    
    println(nullString.isNullOrEmpty()) // true
    println(emptyString.isNullOrEmpty()) // true
    println(validString.isNullOrEmpty()) // false
    
    println(nullString.orDefault("Default")) // "Default"
    println(validString.orDefault("Default")) // "Hello"
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Functions in Kotlin are first-class citizens with powerful syntax and type safety features
- Default parameters and named arguments reduce the need for function overloading and improve code readability
- Single-expression functions provide concise syntax for simple operations
- Local functions offer encapsulation and can access variables from their enclosing scope
- Extension functions allow you to add functionality to existing types without modifying their source code
- Proper use of function features leads to more maintainable and expressive code

**Next Steps:** Master higher-order functions and lambda expressions, explore scope functions (`let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, `also`), and learn about inline functions for performance optimization.

# Collections and Basic OOP

## Kotlin Collections

### Lists, Sets, and Maps

Kotlin provides three main collection types, each serving different purposes and offering both immutable and mutable variants.

#### Lists

Lists are ordered collections that allow duplicate elements and provide indexed access.

```kotlin
// Immutable list creation
val fruits = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val mixedList = listOf("text", 42, true, 3.14)

// Mutable list creation
val mutableFruits = mutableListOf("apple", "banana")
val dynamicNumbers = mutableListOf<Int>()

// List operations
val firstFruit = fruits[0] // or fruits.first()
val lastFruit = fruits.last()
val size = fruits.size
val contains = fruits.contains("apple")
val index = fruits.indexOf("banana")
```

#### Sets

Sets are collections of unique elements without duplicates, useful for membership testing.

```kotlin
// Immutable set creation
val uniqueNumbers = setOf(1, 2, 3, 2, 1) // Result: [1, 2, 3]
val colors = setOf("red", "green", "blue")

// Mutable set creation
val mutableColors = mutableSetOf("red", "green")
val dynamicSet = mutableSetOf<String>()

// Set operations
val hasRed = colors.contains("red")
val union = setOf(1, 2, 3) union setOf(3, 4, 5) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
val intersection = setOf(1, 2, 3) intersect setOf(2, 3, 4) // [2, 3]
val difference = setOf(1, 2, 3) - setOf(2, 3) // [1]
```

#### Maps

Maps store key-value pairs and provide fast lookups by key.

```kotlin
// Immutable map creation
val capitals = mapOf(
    "USA" to "Washington D.C.",
    "France" to "Paris",
    "Japan" to "Tokyo"
)

// Mutable map creation
val mutableCapitals = mutableMapOf("USA" to "Washington D.C.")
val dynamicMap = mutableMapOf<String, Int>()

// Map operations
val usCapital = capitals["USA"]
val keys = capitals.keys
val values = capitals.values
val entries = capitals.entries
val containsKey = capitals.containsKey("France")
val containsValue = capitals.containsValue("Paris")
```

**Key points:**

- Use `listOf()`, `setOf()`, `mapOf()` for immutable collections
- Use `mutableListOf()`, `mutableSetOf()`, `mutableMapOf()` for mutable collections
- Lists maintain insertion order and allow duplicates
- Sets automatically eliminate duplicates
- Maps provide O(1) average lookup time

### Mutable vs Immutable Collections

Understanding the distinction between mutable and immutable collections is crucial for writing safe and predictable code.

#### Immutable Collections

```kotlin
val immutableList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
// immutableList.add(4) // Compilation error - no add method

val immutableSet = setOf("a", "b", "c")
// immutableSet.remove("a") // Compilation error

val immutableMap = mapOf("key1" to "value1")
// immutableMap["key2"] = "value2" // Compilation error
```

#### Mutable Collections

```kotlin
val mutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
mutableList.add(4)
mutableList.remove(2)
mutableList[0] = 10

val mutableSet = mutableSetOf("a", "b", "c")
mutableSet.add("d")
mutableSet.remove("a")

val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("key1" to "value1")
mutableMap["key2"] = "value2"
mutableMap.remove("key1")
```

#### Collection Interfaces Hierarchy

```kotlin
// Read-only interfaces
val readOnlyList: List<String> = mutableListOf("a", "b")
val readOnlySet: Set<String> = mutableSetOf("a", "b")
val readOnlyMap: Map<String, Int> = mutableMapOf("a" to 1)

// Mutable interfaces extend read-only ones
val mutableList: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("a", "b")
val mutableSet: MutableSet<String> = mutableSetOf("a", "b")
val mutableMap: MutableMap<String, Int> = mutableMapOf("a" to 1)
```

#### Converting Between Types

```kotlin
val immutableList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
val mutableCopy = immutableList.toMutableList()

val mutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
val immutableCopy = mutableList.toList()

// Creating defensive copies
fun processItems(items: List<String>): List<String> {
    return items.toList() // Creates a copy to prevent external modification
}
```

**Key points:**

- Immutable collections are thread-safe and prevent accidental modifications
- Mutable collections allow modifications but require careful handling in concurrent environments
- Use immutable collections by default, mutable only when necessary
- Collection interfaces provide read-only views even of mutable collections

### Collection Operations

Kotlin provides extensive functional programming capabilities for collection manipulation.

#### Filtering Operations

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

// Basic filtering
val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
val oddNumbers = numbers.filterNot { it % 2 == 0 }

// Filtering with index
val filteredWithIndex = numbers.filterIndexed { index, value ->
    index % 2 == 0 && value > 3
}

// Filtering non-null values
val nullableNumbers = listOf(1, null, 3, null, 5)
val nonNullNumbers = nullableNumbers.filterNotNull()

// Filtering by type
val mixedList = listOf(1, "hello", 3.14, "world", 42)
val strings = mixedList.filterIsInstance<String>()
```

#### Mapping Operations

```kotlin
val words = listOf("hello", "world", "kotlin")

// Basic mapping
val lengths = words.map { it.length }
val upperCase = words.map { it.uppercase() }

// Mapping with index
val indexedWords = words.mapIndexed { index, word ->
    "$index: $word"
}

// Flat mapping
val sentences = listOf("hello world", "kotlin programming")
val allWords = sentences.flatMap { it.split(" ") }

// Mapping non-null results
val nullableResults = words.mapNotNull { word ->
    if (word.length > 4) word.uppercase() else null
}
```

#### Reducing Operations

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// Sum and product
val sum = numbers.sum()
val product = numbers.reduce { acc, n -> acc * n }

// Folding with initial value
val sumWithInitial = numbers.fold(10) { acc, n -> acc + n }
val concatenated = words.fold("") { acc, word -> acc + word }

// Finding elements
val firstEven = numbers.first { it % 2 == 0 }
val lastOdd = numbers.last { it % 2 == 1 }
val findResult = numbers.find { it > 3 } // Returns first match or null

// Aggregation operations
val max = numbers.maxOrNull()
val min = numbers.minOrNull()
val average = numbers.average()
```

#### Grouping and Partitioning

```kotlin
val words = listOf("apple", "banana", "apricot", "cherry", "avocado")

// Grouping by criteria
val groupedByLength = words.groupBy { it.length }
val groupedByFirstLetter = words.groupBy { it.first() }

// Partitioning
val (shortWords, longWords) = words.partition { it.length <= 5 }

// Chunking
val numbers = (1..10).toList()
val chunks = numbers.chunked(3)
```

#### Chaining Operations

```kotlin
val result = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    .map { it * it }
    .filter { it > 10 }
    .sorted()
    .take(3)
```

**Key points:**

- Operations are lazy when possible and return new collections
- Use method chaining for readable data transformations
- `filter` removes elements, `map` transforms elements
- `reduce` requires non-empty collections, `fold` accepts initial values
- Operations like `find` return nullable results

### Array Basics and When to Use Them

Arrays in Kotlin are similar to arrays in other languages but with enhanced type safety and utility functions.

#### Array Creation

```kotlin
// Creating arrays
val intArray = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val stringArray = arrayOf("hello", "world", "kotlin")
val mixedArray = arrayOf(1, "hello", 3.14, true)

// Typed arrays
val typedIntArray: Array<Int> = arrayOf(1, 2, 3)
val nullableArray: Array<String?> = arrayOfNulls(5)

// Array creation with lambda
val squaredArray = Array(5) { i -> i * i }
val alphabetArray = Array(26) { i -> ('A' + i).toString() }
```

#### Primitive Arrays

```kotlin
// Specialized primitive arrays (more memory efficient)
val intArray = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val doubleArray = doubleArrayOf(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
val booleanArray = booleanArrayOf(true, false, true)
val charArray = charArrayOf('a', 'b', 'c')

// Creating primitive arrays with size
val zeros = IntArray(10) // Array of 10 zeros
val ones = IntArray(10) { 1 } // Array of 10 ones
val sequence = IntArray(10) { it } // [0, 1, 2, ..., 9]
```

#### Array Operations

```kotlin
val numbers = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// Access and modification
val firstElement = numbers[0]
numbers[0] = 10

// Array properties
val size = numbers.size
val indices = numbers.indices
val isEmpty = numbers.isEmpty()

// Converting to collections
val list = numbers.toList()
val set = numbers.toSet()
val mutableList = numbers.toMutableList()

// Array iteration
for (number in numbers) {
    println(number)
}

for ((index, value) in numbers.withIndex()) {
    println("Index $index: $value")
}
```

#### Array vs Collection Operations

```kotlin
val array = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val list = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// Similar operations available on both
val filteredArray = array.filter { it > 2 } // Returns List<Int>
val filteredList = list.filter { it > 2 } // Returns List<Int>

val mappedArray = array.map { it * 2 } // Returns List<Int>
val mappedList = list.map { it * 2 } // Returns List<Int>

// Array-specific operations
val sortedArray = array.sorted() // Returns List<Int>
array.sort() // Sorts array in-place
```

#### When to Use Arrays

```kotlin
// Use arrays when:
// 1. Interoperating with Java code that expects arrays
fun processJavaArray(data: Array<String>) {
    // Java interop
}

// 2. Performance-critical code with primitive types
fun efficientMathOperation(data: IntArray): Int {
    var sum = 0
    for (i in data.indices) {
        sum += data[i] * data[i]
    }
    return sum
}

// 3. Fixed-size collections where size is known
fun createGrid(width: Int, height: Int): Array<Array<Int>> {
    return Array(height) { Array(width) { 0 } }
}

// 4. When you need mutable indexed access
fun bubbleSort(arr: IntArray) {
    for (i in 0 until arr.size - 1) {
        for (j in 0 until arr.size - i - 1) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                val temp = arr[j]
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
                arr[j + 1] = temp
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Array vs List Comparison

```kotlin
// Arrays
val array = arrayOf(1, 2, 3)
// - Fixed size after creation
// - Mutable elements
// - Direct memory layout (primitive arrays)
// - Java interop friendly

// Lists
val list = listOf(1, 2, 3)
// - Can be truly immutable
// - More functional operations
// - Better for most use cases
// - Type-safe operations
```

**Key points:**

- Arrays have fixed size and mutable elements
- Use primitive arrays (`IntArray`, `DoubleArray`, etc.) for performance
- Lists are generally preferred over arrays in Kotlin
- Arrays are necessary for Java interoperability
- Array operations often return Lists, not Arrays

**Example:**

```kotlin
data class Student(val name: String, val grade: Int)

fun main() {
    val students = listOf(
        Student("Alice", 85),
        Student("Bob", 92),
        Student("Charlie", 78),
        Student("Diana", 96)
    )
    
    val analysis = students
        .filter { it.grade >= 80 }
        .map { "${it.name}: ${it.grade}" }
        .sorted()
        .joinToString(", ")
    
    println("High performers: $analysis")
    
    val gradesByFirstLetter = students
        .groupBy { it.name.first() }
        .mapValues { (_, students) -> students.map { it.grade }.average() }
    
    println("Average grades by first letter: $gradesByFirstLetter")
}
```

**Output:**

```
High performers: Alice: 85, Bob: 92, Diana: 96
Average grades by first letter: {A=85.0, B=92.0, C=78.0, D=96.0}
```

Understanding Kotlin collections is essential for effective data manipulation and functional programming. The rich set of operations available makes complex data transformations both readable and efficient.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects

Kotlin classes are declared using the `class` keyword and can contain properties, methods, constructors, and nested classes.

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0
    
    fun introduce() {
        println("Hi, I'm $name and I'm $age years old")
    }
}

// Creating objects
val person = Person()
person.name = "Alice"
person.age = 30
person.introduce()
```

#### Class Declaration Syntax

Classes can be declared with various components in a single line or expanded format.

```kotlin
// Minimal class
class Empty

// Class with primary constructor
class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String)

// Class with body
class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
    val fullName = "$firstName $lastName"
    
    fun greet() = println("Hello, I'm $fullName")
}
```

**Key points:**

- Classes are public and final by default
- Objects are created without `new` keyword
- Class members are accessed using dot notation
- Empty classes don't require curly braces

### Primary and Secondary Constructors

#### Primary Constructor

The primary constructor is part of the class header and cannot contain executable code.

```kotlin
class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
    val fullName: String = "$firstName $lastName"
    
    init {
        println("Person created: $fullName")
    }
}

// Primary constructor with property declarations
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String) {
    val fullName = "$firstName $lastName"
}

// Primary constructor with default values
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String = "Unknown") {
    fun introduce() = println("I'm $firstName $lastName")
}
```

#### Secondary Constructors

Secondary constructors are declared inside the class body using the `constructor` keyword.

```kotlin
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String) {
    var age: Int = 0
    
    // Secondary constructor
    constructor(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int) : this(firstName, lastName) {
        this.age = age
    }
    
    // Another secondary constructor
    constructor(fullName: String) : this(fullName.split(" ")[0], fullName.split(" ")[1])
}

// Usage
val person1 = Person("John", "Doe")
val person2 = Person("Jane", "Smith", 25)
val person3 = Person("Bob Wilson")
```

**Key points:**

- Primary constructor parameters can be properties using `val` or `var`
- Secondary constructors must delegate to primary constructor using `this()`
- Default parameter values reduce need for multiple constructors
- Constructor parameters without `val`/`var` are just initialization parameters

### Properties and Fields

#### Property Declaration

Properties in Kotlin combine field storage with getter/setter methods.

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String = ""        // Mutable property
    val birthYear: Int = 1990    // Read-only property
    
    // Property with custom getter
    val age: Int
        get() = 2024 - birthYear
    
    // Property with custom getter and setter
    var nickname: String = ""
        get() = field.uppercase()
        set(value) {
            field = value.trim()
        }
}
```

#### Backing Fields

The `field` identifier references the backing field within property accessors.

```kotlin
class Temperature {
    var celsius: Double = 0.0
        set(value) {
            if (value >= -273.15) {
                field = value
            } else {
                throw IllegalArgumentException("Temperature cannot be below absolute zero")
            }
        }
    
    val fahrenheit: Double
        get() = celsius * 9/5 + 32
    
    val kelvin: Double
        get() = celsius + 273.15
}
```

#### Late-Initialized Properties

Properties that are initialized after object creation using `lateinit`.

```kotlin
class DatabaseConnection {
    lateinit var connection: Connection
    
    fun connect() {
        connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:...")
    }
    
    fun isConnected(): Boolean {
        return ::connection.isInitialized && !connection.isClosed
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Properties automatically generate getter/setter methods
- `field` identifier accesses backing field in custom accessors
- `lateinit` delays property initialization for non-null properties
- Custom getters/setters enable computed and validated properties

### Init Blocks

Init blocks contain initialization code that runs when an object is created.

```kotlin
class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
    val fullName: String
    
    init {
        println("Initializing person...")
        fullName = "$firstName $lastName".trim()
        require(fullName.isNotEmpty()) { "Name cannot be empty" }
    }
    
    init {
        println("Person created: $fullName")
    }
}
```

#### Multiple Init Blocks

Classes can have multiple init blocks that execute in order of appearance.

```kotlin
class ComplexInitialization(val data: String) {
    val processedData: String
    val metadata: Map<String, Any>
    
    init {
        println("Starting initialization...")
        processedData = data.uppercase()
    }
    
    init {
        println("Processing metadata...")
        metadata = mapOf(
            "length" to processedData.length,
            "created" to System.currentTimeMillis()
        )
    }
    
    init {
        println("Initialization complete")
    }
}
```

#### Init Blocks with Secondary Constructors

Init blocks run before secondary constructor bodies.

```kotlin
class Example {
    init {
        println("Init block executed")
    }
    
    constructor(value: String) {
        println("Secondary constructor executed")
    }
}

// Output when created:
// Init block executed
// Secondary constructor executed
```

**Key points:**

- Init blocks execute in order of appearance
- Init blocks run before secondary constructor bodies
- Use init blocks for complex initialization logic
- Primary constructor parameters are available in init blocks

### Visibility Modifiers

Kotlin provides four visibility modifiers that control access to classes, properties, and functions.

#### Public (Default)

Public members are accessible from anywhere.

```kotlin
class PublicExample {
    public val publicProperty = "Accessible everywhere"
    val defaultProperty = "Also public by default"
    
    public fun publicFunction() = "Called from anywhere"
    fun defaultFunction() = "Also public by default"
}
```

#### Private

Private members are only accessible within the same class.

```kotlin
class PrivateExample {
    private val secretData = "Hidden from outside"
    private var internalCounter = 0
    
    private fun incrementCounter() {
        internalCounter++
    }
    
    fun performAction() {
        incrementCounter()  // OK - same class
        println("Action performed $internalCounter times")
    }
}
```

#### Protected

Protected members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.

```kotlin
open class BaseClass {
    protected val protectedProperty = "Visible to subclasses"
    private val privateProperty = "Not visible to subclasses"
    
    protected fun protectedMethod() {
        println("Available in subclasses")
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass() {
    fun accessProtected() {
        println(protectedProperty)  // OK
        protectedMethod()          // OK
        // println(privateProperty)  // Error - not accessible
    }
}
```

#### Internal

Internal members are accessible within the same module.

```kotlin
// In module A
internal class InternalClass {
    internal val internalProperty = "Visible within module"
    
    internal fun internalMethod() {
        println("Available in same module")
    }
}

// In same module
class SameModuleClass {
    fun useInternal() {
        val obj = InternalClass()  // OK - same module
        println(obj.internalProperty)
    }
}
```

#### Visibility in Constructors

Constructors can also have visibility modifiers.

```kotlin
class RestrictedAccess private constructor(val data: String) {
    companion object {
        fun create(input: String): RestrictedAccess? {
            return if (input.isNotEmpty()) {
                RestrictedAccess(input)
            } else null
        }
    }
}

// Usage
val obj = RestrictedAccess.create("valid data")  // OK
// val direct = RestrictedAccess("data")  // Error - private constructor
```

**Key points:**

- `public` is the default visibility modifier
- `private` restricts access to the declaring class
- `protected` allows access in subclasses but not other classes
- `internal` provides module-level visibility
- Visibility modifiers can be applied to constructors

### Nested and Inner Classes

#### Nested Classes

Nested classes are declared inside other classes but don't have access to outer class instances.

```kotlin
class Outer {
    private val outerProperty = "Outer"
    
    class Nested {
        fun nestedFunction() = "Nested class function"
        // Cannot access outerProperty
    }
}

// Usage
val nested = Outer.Nested()
println(nested.nestedFunction())
```

#### Inner Classes

Inner classes are marked with `inner` and have access to outer class members.

```kotlin
class Outer {
    private val outerProperty = "Outer"
    
    inner class Inner {
        fun innerFunction() = "Accessing $outerProperty from inner class"
    }
}

// Usage
val outer = Outer()
val inner = outer.Inner()
println(inner.innerFunction())
```

**Key points:**

- Nested classes don't hold references to outer class instances
- Inner classes can access outer class members
- Inner classes require outer class instance for creation
- Use nested classes for helper classes that don't need outer access

**Related topics:** Inheritance and polymorphism, interfaces and abstract classes, data classes and sealed classes, companion objects, and generics extend these object-oriented programming concepts.

# Advanced OOP

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Class Inheritance

Kotlin classes are final by default, requiring the `open` modifier to enable inheritance. This design promotes composition over inheritance and prevents fragile base class problems.

```kotlin
// Base class - must be open for inheritance
open class Animal(val name: String, val species: String) {
    open val sound: String = "Some sound"
    
    open fun makeSound() {
        println("$name makes a $sound")
    }
    
    open fun move() {
        println("$name is moving")
    }
    
    // Final method - cannot be overridden
    fun sleep() {
        println("$name is sleeping")
    }
}

// Derived class
class Dog(name: String, val breed: String) : Animal(name, "Canine") {
    override val sound: String = "woof"
    
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("$name barks: $sound")
    }
    
    override fun move() {
        super.move() // Call parent implementation
        println("$name runs on four legs")
    }
    
    // Additional method specific to Dog
    fun fetch() {
        println("$name fetches the ball")
    }
}

// Multiple inheritance levels
open class Mammal(name: String, species: String) : Animal(name, species) {
    open val bodyTemperature: Double = 37.0
    
    open fun regulate() {
        println("$name regulates body temperature")
    }
}

class Cat(name: String, val breed: String) : Mammal(name, "Feline") {
    override val sound: String = "meow"
    override val bodyTemperature: Double = 38.5
    
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("$name meows: $sound")
    }
    
    fun purr() {
        println("$name purrs contentedly")
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Classes and methods are final by default
- `open` keyword enables inheritance and overriding
- `override` keyword is mandatory for overriding members
- `super` keyword accesses parent class implementations
- Primary constructor parameters can be passed to parent constructors
- Derived classes can add their own properties and methods

### Abstract Classes and Members

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract members that must be implemented by subclasses.

```kotlin
// Abstract base class
abstract class Shape {
    abstract val area: Double
    abstract val perimeter: Double
    
    // Abstract method
    abstract fun draw()
    
    // Concrete method
    fun display() {
        println("Shape with area: $area and perimeter: $perimeter")
        draw()
    }
    
    // Abstract property with custom getter
    abstract val description: String
        get() = "This is a shape"
}

// Concrete implementation
class Circle(val radius: Double) : Shape() {
    override val area: Double
        get() = Math.PI * radius * radius
    
    override val perimeter: Double
        get() = 2 * Math.PI * radius
    
    override fun draw() {
        println("Drawing a circle with radius $radius")
    }
    
    override val description: String = "Circle"
}

class Rectangle(val width: Double, val height: Double) : Shape() {
    override val area: Double = width * height
    override val perimeter: Double = 2 * (width + height)
    
    override fun draw() {
        println("Drawing a rectangle ${width}x${height}")
    }
    
    override val description: String = "Rectangle"
}

// Abstract class with constructor
abstract class Vehicle(val brand: String, val model: String) {
    abstract val maxSpeed: Int
    abstract fun start()
    abstract fun stop()
    
    fun info() {
        println("$brand $model - Max speed: $maxSpeed km/h")
    }
}

class Car(brand: String, model: String, override val maxSpeed: Int) : Vehicle(brand, model) {
    override fun start() {
        println("Car engine started")
    }
    
    override fun stop() {
        println("Car engine stopped")
    }
}

// Abstract class with template method pattern
abstract class DataProcessor<T> {
    abstract fun loadData(): List<T>
    abstract fun processItem(item: T): T
    abstract fun saveData(data: List<T>)
    
    // Template method
    fun execute() {
        val data = loadData()
        val processed = data.map { processItem(it) }
        saveData(processed)
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
- Abstract members must be implemented by subclasses
- Abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete members
- Abstract properties can have custom getters/setters
- Abstract classes can have constructors
- Useful for template method pattern and shared behavior

### Interfaces and Implementation

Interfaces define contracts that classes must fulfill and support multiple inheritance.

```kotlin
// Basic interface
interface Drawable {
    fun draw()
    fun resize(factor: Double)
}

// Interface with default implementation
interface Clickable {
    fun click()
    
    // Default implementation
    fun doubleClick() {
        println("Double clicked")
        click()
        click()
    }
    
    // Property with default getter
    val isEnabled: Boolean
        get() = true
}

// Interface with properties
interface Named {
    val name: String
    val displayName: String
        get() = name.uppercase()
}

// Multiple interface implementation
class Button(override val name: String) : Clickable, Drawable, Named {
    override fun click() {
        println("Button $name clicked")
    }
    
    override fun draw() {
        println("Drawing button $name")
    }
    
    override fun resize(factor: Double) {
        println("Resizing button $name by factor $factor")
    }
}

// Interface inheritance
interface Movable {
    fun move(dx: Int, dy: Int)
}

interface Transformable : Drawable, Movable {
    fun rotate(angle: Double)
    fun scale(factor: Double)
}

// Resolving conflicts between interfaces
interface A {
    fun foo() {
        println("A.foo()")
    }
}

interface B {
    fun foo() {
        println("B.foo()")
    }
}

class C : A, B {
    override fun foo() {
        super<A>.foo() // Call A's implementation
        super<B>.foo() // Call B's implementation
        println("C.foo()")
    }
}

// Functional interfaces (SAM interfaces)
fun interface Predicate<T> {
    fun test(t: T): Boolean
}

// Usage with lambda
val isPositive = Predicate<Int> { it > 0 }
val numbers = listOf(-1, 2, -3, 4)
val positiveNumbers = numbers.filter(isPositive::test)
```

**Key points:**

- Interfaces define contracts without implementation constraints
- Can contain abstract and concrete members
- Support multiple inheritance
- Default implementations reduce boilerplate
- Conflicts resolved with explicit `super<Interface>` calls
- Functional interfaces enable SAM conversion with lambdas

### Polymorphism in Practice

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly through common interfaces or base classes.

```kotlin
// Polymorphism with abstract classes
abstract class Employee(val name: String, val id: Int) {
    abstract fun calculateSalary(): Double
    abstract fun getRole(): String
    
    fun displayInfo() {
        println("$name (ID: $id) - ${getRole()}: ${calculateSalary()}")
    }
}

class Developer(name: String, id: Int, val hourlyRate: Double, val hoursWorked: Int) : Employee(name, id) {
    override fun calculateSalary(): Double = hourlyRate * hoursWorked
    override fun getRole(): String = "Developer"
}

class Manager(name: String, id: Int, val baseSalary: Double, val bonus: Double) : Employee(name, id) {
    override fun calculateSalary(): Double = baseSalary + bonus
    override fun getRole(): String = "Manager"
}

// Polymorphic usage
fun processEmployees(employees: List<Employee>) {
    employees.forEach { employee ->
        employee.displayInfo() // Calls appropriate implementation
        
        // Type checking and casting
        when (employee) {
            is Developer -> println("  Hours worked: ${employee.hoursWorked}")
            is Manager -> println("  Bonus: ${employee.bonus}")
        }
    }
}

// Interface-based polymorphism
interface PaymentProcessor {
    fun processPayment(amount: Double): Boolean
    fun getProviderName(): String
}

class CreditCardProcessor : PaymentProcessor {
    override fun processPayment(amount: Double): Boolean {
        println("Processing credit card payment: $$amount")
        return true
    }
    
    override fun getProviderName(): String = "Credit Card"
}

class PayPalProcessor : PaymentProcessor {
    override fun processPayment(amount: Double): Boolean {
        println("Processing PayPal payment: $$amount")
        return true
    }
    
    override fun getProviderName(): String = "PayPal"
}

class BankTransferProcessor : PaymentProcessor {
    override fun processPayment(amount: Double): Boolean {
        println("Processing bank transfer: $$amount")
        return true
    }
    
    override fun getProviderName(): String = "Bank Transfer"
}

// Polymorphic payment processing
class PaymentService {
    fun processPayment(processor: PaymentProcessor, amount: Double) {
        println("Using ${processor.getProviderName()}")
        val success = processor.processPayment(amount)
        if (success) {
            println("Payment processed successfully")
        } else {
            println("Payment failed")
        }
    }
}

// Generic polymorphism
interface Repository<T> {
    fun save(item: T)
    fun findById(id: String): T?
    fun findAll(): List<T>
    fun delete(id: String)
}

class UserRepository : Repository<User> {
    private val users = mutableMapOf<String, User>()
    
    override fun save(item: User) {
        users[item.id] = item
    }
    
    override fun findById(id: String): User? = users[id]
    override fun findAll(): List<User> = users.values.toList()
    override fun delete(id: String) { users.remove(id) }
}

// Polymorphism with sealed classes
sealed class Result<out T>
data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
data class Error(val message: String) : Result<Nothing>()

fun <T> handleResult(result: Result<T>) {
    when (result) {
        is Success -> println("Success: ${result.data}")
        is Error -> println("Error: ${result.message}")
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Polymorphism enables treating different types uniformly
- Runtime type checking with `is` operator
- Smart casting automatically casts after type checks
- Interface-based polymorphism promotes loose coupling
- Generic polymorphism provides type-safe flexibility
- Sealed classes enable exhaustive polymorphic handling

### Advanced Inheritance Patterns

```kotlin
// Delegation pattern
interface Engine {
    fun start()
    fun stop()
}

class GasEngine : Engine {
    override fun start() = println("Gas engine started")
    override fun stop() = println("Gas engine stopped")
}

class ElectricEngine : Engine {
    override fun start() = println("Electric engine started")
    override fun stop() = println("Electric engine stopped")
}

// Class delegation
class Car(private val engine: Engine) : Engine by engine {
    fun drive() {
        start() // Delegates to engine
        println("Car is driving")
        stop() // Delegates to engine
    }
}

// Mixin pattern with interfaces
interface Flyable {
    fun fly() = println("Flying")
}

interface Swimmable {
    fun swim() = println("Swimming")
}

class Duck : Flyable, Swimmable {
    fun move() {
        fly()
        swim()
    }
}

// Strategy pattern with polymorphism
interface SortingStrategy {
    fun <T : Comparable<T>> sort(list: MutableList<T>)
}

class QuickSort : SortingStrategy {
    override fun <T : Comparable<T>> sort(list: MutableList<T>) {
        // QuickSort implementation
        println("Sorting with QuickSort")
    }
}

class MergeSort : SortingStrategy {
    override fun <T : Comparable<T>> sort(list: MutableList<T>) {
        // MergeSort implementation
        println("Sorting with MergeSort")
    }
}

class Sorter(private var strategy: SortingStrategy) {
    fun setStrategy(strategy: SortingStrategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy
    }
    
    fun <T : Comparable<T>> sort(list: MutableList<T>) {
        strategy.sort(list)
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Delegation promotes composition over inheritance
- `by` keyword provides automatic delegation
- Mixin pattern combines multiple behaviors
- Strategy pattern leverages polymorphism for algorithm selection
- Polymorphism enables flexible design patterns

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

```kotlin
// Prefer composition over inheritance
// Good
class Car(private val engine: Engine) {
    fun start() = engine.start()
}

// Less flexible
open class Vehicle
class Car : Vehicle() // Tight coupling

// Use sealed classes for restricted hierarchies
sealed class UIEvent
data class Click(val x: Int, val y: Int) : UIEvent()
data class Scroll(val direction: String) : UIEvent()

// Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies
// Bad
class A
open class B : A()
open class C : B()
class D : C() // Too deep

// Good - prefer interfaces and composition
interface Printable
interface Scannable
class MultiFunctionPrinter : Printable, Scannable

// Use abstract classes for shared state and behavior
abstract class BaseActivity {
    protected val commonData = mutableMapOf<String, Any>()
    
    abstract fun onCreate()
    
    protected fun log(message: String) {
        println("[$javaClass.simpleName] $message")
    }
}

// Prefer dependency injection for polymorphism
class ServiceLayer(private val repository: Repository<User>) {
    fun getUser(id: String) = repository.findById(id)
}
```

**Key points:**

- Favor composition over inheritance for flexibility
- Use sealed classes for controlled hierarchies
- Avoid deep inheritance trees
- Abstract classes for shared state, interfaces for contracts
- Dependency injection enables testable polymorphism
- Consider the Liskov Substitution Principle when designing hierarchies

## Advanced Class Features

### Data Classes and Their Benefits

Data classes in Kotlin are specifically designed to hold data and automatically generate common functionality that would otherwise require boilerplate code in regular classes.

### Basic Data Class Declaration

```kotlin
data class User(
    val id: Int,
    val name: String,
    val email: String,
    val age: Int
)

// Automatically generated functions:
// - equals() and hashCode()
// - toString()
// - copy()
// - componentN() functions for destructuring
```

### Generated Functions Demonstration

```kotlin
fun demonstrateDataClassFeatures() {
    val user1 = User(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 25)
    val user2 = User(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 25)
    val user3 = User(2, "Bob", "bob@example.com", 30)
    
    // toString() - automatically generated
    println(user1) // User(id=1, name=Alice, email=alice@example.com, age=25)
    
    // equals() - structural equality
    println(user1 == user2) // true (same data)
    println(user1 == user3) // false (different data)
    
    // hashCode() - consistent with equals()
    println(user1.hashCode() == user2.hashCode()) // true
    
    // copy() - create modified copies
    val olderUser = user1.copy(age = 26)
    println(olderUser) // User(id=1, name=Alice, email=alice@example.com, age=26)
    
    // Destructuring declarations
    val (id, name, email, age) = user1
    println("User $id: $name ($email), age $age")
}
```

### Advanced Data Class Features

```kotlin
data class Product(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val price: Double,
    val category: String,
    val inStock: Boolean = true,
    val tags: List<String> = emptyList()
) {
    // Data classes can have custom methods
    fun isExpensive(): Boolean = price > 100.0
    
    fun addTag(tag: String): Product = copy(tags = tags + tag)
    
    // Custom validation
    init {
        require(price >= 0) { "Price cannot be negative" }
        require(name.isNotBlank()) { "Product name cannot be blank" }
    }
}

// Using advanced features
fun demonstrateAdvancedDataClass() {
    val laptop = Product(
        id = "LT001",
        name = "Gaming Laptop",
        price = 1299.99,
        category = "Electronics",
        tags = listOf("gaming", "portable")
    )
    
    val updatedLaptop = laptop
        .copy(price = 1199.99)
        .addTag("on-sale")
    
    println("Is expensive: ${laptop.isExpensive()}")
    println("Updated product: $updatedLaptop")
}
```

### Data Class with Complex Types

```kotlin
data class Address(
    val street: String,
    val city: String,
    val zipCode: String,
    val country: String
)

data class Contact(
    val email: String,
    val phone: String?
)

data class Customer(
    val id: Long,
    val name: String,
    val address: Address,
    val contact: Contact,
    val orders: List<String> = emptyList()
) {
    fun addOrder(orderId: String): Customer = copy(orders = orders + orderId)
    
    fun updateAddress(newAddress: Address): Customer = copy(address = newAddress)
    
    fun updateContact(newContact: Contact): Customer = copy(contact = newContact)
}

// Nested data class usage
fun demonstrateNestedDataClasses() {
    val customer = Customer(
        id = 1001,
        name = "John Doe",
        address = Address("123 Main St", "Springfield", "12345", "USA"),
        contact = Contact("john@example.com", "+1-555-0123")
    )
    
    val updatedCustomer = customer
        .addOrder("ORD-001")
        .addOrder("ORD-002")
        .updateAddress(customer.address.copy(street = "456 Oak Ave"))
    
    println("Original: ${customer.address.street}")
    println("Updated: ${updatedCustomer.address.street}")
    println("Orders: ${updatedCustomer.orders}")
}
```

### Sealed Classes and When Expressions

Sealed classes represent restricted class hierarchies where all subclasses are known at compile time, making them perfect for representing finite sets of possibilities.

### Basic Sealed Class Declaration

```kotlin
sealed class Result<out T> {
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error(val exception: Exception) : Result<Nothing>()
    object Loading : Result<Nothing>()
}

// Usage with when expressions
fun handleResult(result: Result<String>) {
    when (result) {
        is Result.Success -> println("Data: ${result.data}")
        is Result.Error -> println("Error: ${result.exception.message}")
        is Result.Loading -> println("Loading...")
        // No need for else clause - compiler knows all cases are covered
    }
}
```

### Advanced Sealed Class Example

```kotlin
sealed class NetworkResponse<out T> {
    data class Success<T>(val data: T, val statusCode: Int = 200) : NetworkResponse<T>()
    data class Error(val code: Int, val message: String) : NetworkResponse<Nothing>()
    object Timeout : NetworkResponse<Nothing>()
    object NetworkUnavailable : NetworkResponse<Nothing>()
    
    // Sealed classes can have abstract methods
    abstract fun isSuccessful(): Boolean
    
    // Common functionality
    fun log() {
        when (this) {
            is Success -> println("Success: $statusCode")
            is Error -> println("Error: $code - $message")
            is Timeout -> println("Request timed out")
            is NetworkUnavailable -> println("Network unavailable")
        }
    }
}

// Implementing abstract methods in subclasses
fun NetworkResponse<*>.isSuccessful(): Boolean = when (this) {
    is NetworkResponse.Success -> true
    else -> false
}
```

### Complex Sealed Class Hierarchy

```kotlin
sealed class PaymentMethod {
    data class CreditCard(
        val number: String,
        val expiryMonth: Int,
        val expiryYear: Int,
        val cvv: String
    ) : PaymentMethod()
    
    data class PayPal(val email: String) : PaymentMethod()
    
    data class BankTransfer(
        val accountNumber: String,
        val routingNumber: String,
        val bankName: String
    ) : PaymentMethod()
    
    object Cash : PaymentMethod()
}

sealed class PaymentResult {
    data class Success(val transactionId: String, val amount: Double) : PaymentResult()
    data class Failure(val reason: String, val errorCode: Int) : PaymentResult()
    data class Pending(val estimatedTime: String) : PaymentResult()
}

fun processPayment(method: PaymentMethod, amount: Double): PaymentResult {
    return when (method) {
        is PaymentMethod.CreditCard -> {
            // Validate credit card
            if (method.number.length == 16) {
                PaymentResult.Success("TXN-${System.currentTimeMillis()}", amount)
            } else {
                PaymentResult.Failure("Invalid card number", 400)
            }
        }
        is PaymentMethod.PayPal -> {
            PaymentResult.Pending("2-3 business days")
        }
        is PaymentMethod.BankTransfer -> {
            PaymentResult.Pending("1-2 business days")
        }
        is PaymentMethod.Cash -> {
            PaymentResult.Success("CASH-${System.currentTimeMillis()}", amount)
        }
    }
}
```

### Sealed Classes with Generic Types

```kotlin
sealed class Resource<out T> {
    object Loading : Resource<Nothing>()
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Resource<T>()
    data class Error(val message: String, val cause: Throwable? = null) : Resource<Nothing>()
}

// Extension functions for sealed classes
fun <T> Resource<T>.onSuccess(action: (T) -> Unit): Resource<T> {
    if (this is Resource.Success) action(data)
    return this
}

fun <T> Resource<T>.onError(action: (String) -> Unit): Resource<T> {
    if (this is Resource.Error) action(message)
    return this
}

fun <T> Resource<T>.onLoading(action: () -> Unit): Resource<T> {
    if (this is Resource.Loading) action()
    return this
}

// Usage example
fun handleApiResponse(response: Resource<List<User>>) {
    response
        .onLoading { println("Loading users...") }
        .onSuccess { users -> println("Loaded ${users.size} users") }
        .onError { error -> println("Failed to load users: $error") }
}
```

### Enum Classes and Their Use Cases

Enum classes represent a finite set of constants and can contain properties, methods, and implement interfaces.

### Basic Enum Declaration

```kotlin
enum class Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
}

// Enum with properties
enum class Priority(val level: Int) {
    LOW(1),
    MEDIUM(2),
    HIGH(3),
    CRITICAL(4)
}

// Using enums
fun demonstrateBasicEnums() {
    val direction = Direction.NORTH
    val priority = Priority.HIGH
    
    println("Direction: $direction")
    println("Priority: $priority (level: ${priority.level})")
    
    // Enum properties
    println("All directions: ${Direction.values().joinToString()}")
    println("Priority ordinal: ${priority.ordinal}")
}
```

### Advanced Enum Features

```kotlin
enum class HttpStatus(val code: Int, val description: String) {
    OK(200, "OK"),
    CREATED(201, "Created"),
    BAD_REQUEST(400, "Bad Request"),
    UNAUTHORIZED(401, "Unauthorized"),
    NOT_FOUND(404, "Not Found"),
    INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR(500, "Internal Server Error");
    
    // Enum methods
    fun isSuccess(): Boolean = code in 200..299
    fun isClientError(): Boolean = code in 400..499
    fun isServerError(): Boolean = code in 500..599
    
    // Companion object for enum
    companion object {
        fun fromCode(code: Int): HttpStatus? = values().find { it.code == code }
        
        fun getSuccessStatuses(): List<HttpStatus> = values().filter { it.isSuccess() }
    }
}

// Usage example
fun handleHttpResponse(statusCode: Int) {
    val status = HttpStatus.fromCode(statusCode)
    
    when (status) {
        HttpStatus.OK -> println("Request successful")
        HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND -> println("Resource not found")
        HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR -> println("Server error occurred")
        null -> println("Unknown status code: $statusCode")
        else -> println("Status: ${status.description}")
    }
}
```

### Enum with Abstract Methods

```kotlin
enum class Operation {
    ADD {
        override fun execute(a: Double, b: Double): Double = a + b
    },
    SUBTRACT {
        override fun execute(a: Double, b: Double): Double = a - b
    },
    MULTIPLY {
        override fun execute(a: Double, b: Double): Double = a * b
    },
    DIVIDE {
        override fun execute(a: Double, b: Double): Double {
            require(b != 0.0) { "Division by zero" }
            return a / b
        }
    };
    
    abstract fun execute(a: Double, b: Double): Double
    
    fun calculate(a: Double, b: Double): String {
        return try {
            "Result: ${execute(a, b)}"
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            "Error: ${e.message}"
        }
    }
}

// Using enum with abstract methods
fun demonstrateEnumOperations() {
    val operations = listOf(
        Triple(Operation.ADD, 5.0, 3.0),
        Triple(Operation.DIVIDE, 10.0, 0.0),
        Triple(Operation.MULTIPLY, 4.0, 2.5)
    )
    
    operations.forEach { (op, a, b) ->
        println("$op: ${op.calculate(a, b)}")
    }
}
```

### Enum Implementing Interfaces

```kotlin
interface Drawable {
    fun draw()
}

enum class Shape : Drawable {
    CIRCLE {
        override fun draw() = println("Drawing a circle")
    },
    SQUARE {
        override fun draw() = println("Drawing a square")
    },
    TRIANGLE {
        override fun draw() = println("Drawing a triangle")
    };
    
    // Common enum functionality
    fun getArea(size: Double): Double = when (this) {
        CIRCLE -> Math.PI * size * size
        SQUARE -> size * size
        TRIANGLE -> 0.5 * size * size
    }
}
```

### Object Declarations and Expressions

Object declarations create singleton instances, while object expressions create anonymous objects for immediate use.

### Object Declarations (Singletons)

```kotlin
// Singleton object
object DatabaseManager {
    private val connections = mutableMapOf<String, String>()
    
    fun connect(database: String): String {
        return connections.getOrPut(database) {
            "Connection to $database established"
        }
    }
    
    fun disconnect(database: String) {
        connections.remove(database)
        println("Disconnected from $database")
    }
    
    fun getActiveConnections(): List<String> = connections.keys.toList()
}

// Usage
fun demonstrateObjectDeclaration() {
    println(DatabaseManager.connect("UserDB"))
    println(DatabaseManager.connect("ProductDB"))
    println("Active connections: ${DatabaseManager.getActiveConnections()}")
    
    DatabaseManager.disconnect("UserDB")
    println("Remaining connections: ${DatabaseManager.getActiveConnections()}")
}
```

### Object Expressions (Anonymous Objects)

```kotlin
interface EventListener {
    fun onClick()
    fun onDoubleClick()
}

fun createButton(text: String): Any {
    return object : EventListener {
        val buttonText = text
        
        override fun onClick() {
            println("Button '$buttonText' clicked")
        }
        
        override fun onDoubleClick() {
            println("Button '$buttonText' double-clicked")
        }
        
        fun getButtonInfo() = "Button: $buttonText"
    }
}

// Object expressions for functional interfaces
fun demonstrateObjectExpressions() {
    val button = createButton("Submit")
    
    if (button is EventListener) {
        button.onClick()
        button.onDoubleClick()
    }
    
    // Object expression with multiple interfaces
    val multiHandler = object : EventListener, Runnable {
        override fun onClick() = println("Multi-handler click")
        override fun onDoubleClick() = println("Multi-handler double-click")
        override fun run() = println("Multi-handler running")
    }
    
    multiHandler.onClick()
    multiHandler.run()
}
```

### Object Expressions with Closures

```kotlin
fun createCounter(initial: Int = 0) = object {
    private var count = initial
    
    fun increment(): Int = ++count
    fun decrement(): Int = --count
    fun reset() { count = initial }
    fun getValue(): Int = count
}

fun createValidator(rules: List<String>) = object {
    private val validationRules = rules.toList()
    
    fun validate(input: String): Boolean {
        return validationRules.all { rule ->
            when (rule) {
                "not_empty" -> input.isNotEmpty()
                "min_length_3" -> input.length >= 3
                "contains_digit" -> input.any { it.isDigit() }
                "contains_uppercase" -> input.any { it.isUpperCase() }
                else -> true
            }
        }
    }
    
    fun getRules(): List<String> = validationRules
}
```

### Companion Objects

Companion objects provide a way to add static-like functionality to classes and can implement interfaces.

### Basic Companion Object

```kotlin
class MathUtils {
    companion object {
        const val PI = 3.14159
        
        fun calculateCircleArea(radius: Double): Double {
            return PI * radius * radius
        }
        
        fun calculateRectangleArea(width: Double, height: Double): Double {
            return width * height
        }
    }
}

// Usage - looks like static methods
fun demonstrateCompanionObject() {
    println("Circle area: ${MathUtils.calculateCircleArea(5.0)}")
    println("Rectangle area: ${MathUtils.calculateRectangleArea(4.0, 6.0)}")
    println("PI value: ${MathUtils.PI}")
}
```

### Named Companion Objects

```kotlin
class User(val name: String, val email: String) {
    companion object Factory {
        fun createFromEmail(email: String): User {
            val name = email.substringBefore("@")
            return User(name, email)
        }
        
        fun createGuest(): User {
            return User("Guest", "guest@example.com")
        }
        
        fun isValidEmail(email: String): Boolean {
            return email.contains("@") && email.contains(".")
        }
    }
}

// Usage with named companion object
fun demonstrateNamedCompanionObject() {
    val user1 = User.createFromEmail("john.doe@example.com")
    val user2 = User.Factory.createGuest()
    
    println("User 1: ${user1.name}")
    println("User 2: ${user2.name}")
    println("Valid email: ${User.isValidEmail("test@example.com")}")
}
```

### Companion Objects Implementing Interfaces

```kotlin
interface JsonSerializable {
    fun toJson(): String
    fun fromJson(json: String): JsonSerializable
}

class Product(val name: String, val price: Double) {
    companion object : JsonSerializable {
        override fun toJson(): String {
            return "Companion object doesn't serialize"
        }
        
        override fun fromJson(json: String): Product {
            // Simplified JSON parsing
            val parts = json.removeSurrounding("{", "}")
                .split(",")
                .associate { 
                    val (key, value) = it.split(":")
                    key.trim().removeSurrounding("\"") to value.trim().removeSurrounding("\"")
                }
            
            return Product(
                parts["name"] ?: "Unknown",
                parts["price"]?.toDoubleOrNull() ?: 0.0
            )
        }
        
        fun createSampleProduct(): Product {
            return Product("Sample Product", 99.99)
        }
    }
    
    fun toJson(): String {
        return """{"name": "$name", "price": "$price"}"""
    }
}

// Usage
fun demonstrateCompanionObjectInterface() {
    val product = Product.createSampleProduct()
    val json = product.toJson()
    println("JSON: $json")
    
    val deserializedProduct = Product.fromJson(json)
    println("Deserialized: ${deserializedProduct.name} - ${deserializedProduct.price}")
}
```

### Advanced Companion Object Features

```kotlin
class ApiClient private constructor(private val baseUrl: String) {
    companion object {
        @Volatile
        private var INSTANCE: ApiClient? = null
        
        fun getInstance(baseUrl: String = "https://api.example.com"): ApiClient {
            return INSTANCE ?: synchronized(this) {
                INSTANCE ?: ApiClient(baseUrl).also { INSTANCE = it }
            }
        }
        
        // Extension function on companion object
        fun ApiClient.Companion.createTestInstance(): ApiClient {
            return ApiClient("https://test.api.example.com")
        }
    }
    
    fun makeRequest(endpoint: String): String {
        return "Request to $baseUrl$endpoint"
    }
}

// Using advanced companion object features
fun demonstrateAdvancedCompanionObject() {
    val client1 = ApiClient.getInstance()
    val client2 = ApiClient.getInstance()
    val testClient = ApiClient.createTestInstance()
    
    println("Same instance: ${client1 === client2}")
    println("Request: ${client1.makeRequest("/users")}")
    println("Test request: ${testClient.makeRequest("/test")}")
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Data classes automatically generate essential methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `copy()`
- Sealed classes provide type-safe representation of restricted class hierarchies with exhaustive when expressions
- Enum classes offer powerful ways to represent finite sets of constants with properties and methods
- Object declarations create thread-safe singletons, while object expressions create anonymous objects
- Companion objects provide static-like functionality and can implement interfaces for advanced patterns
- These features reduce boilerplate code while maintaining type safety and expressiveness

**Next Steps:** Explore delegation patterns with `by` keyword, advanced generic constraints, and inline classes for performance optimization.

# Functional Programming

## Kotlin Lambda Expressions

### Lambda Syntax and Usage

Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can be treated as values, passed as arguments, or stored in variables. They provide a concise way to write functional code.

#### Basic Lambda Syntax

```kotlin
// Full lambda syntax
val sum = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }

// Lambda with single parameter
val square = { x: Int -> x * x }

// Lambda with inferred types
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 } // 'it' is implicit single parameter

// Multi-line lambda
val complexOperation = { x: Int, y: Int ->
    val temp = x * 2
    val result = temp + y
    result // Last expression is returned
}
```

#### Lambda Parameter Variations

```kotlin
// No parameters
val greeting = { println("Hello, World!") }

// Single parameter with 'it'
val isEven = { number: Int -> number % 2 == 0 }
val isEvenShort = { it % 2 == 0 } // Using 'it' for single parameter

// Multiple parameters
val multiply = { a: Int, b: Int -> a * b }

// Destructuring parameters
val pairs = listOf(1 to "one", 2 to "two", 3 to "three")
val descriptions = pairs.map { (number, word) -> "$number is $word" }

// Unused parameters
val processFirst = { first: String, _: String -> first.uppercase() }
```

#### Lambda Invocation

```kotlin
// Direct invocation
val result = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }(5, 3) // Returns 8

// Stored in variable
val operation = { x: Int, y: Int -> x * y }
val product = operation(4, 6) // Returns 24

// Using invoke operator
val calculator = { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }
val sum = calculator.invoke(2, 3) // Returns 5
```

#### Trailing Lambda Syntax

```kotlin
// When lambda is last parameter, it can be outside parentheses
val filtered = numbers.filter({ it > 3 })
val filteredTrailing = numbers.filter { it > 3 } // Preferred style

// If lambda is only parameter, parentheses can be omitted
val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }

// Multiple lambdas
val result = numbers.fold(0, { acc, element -> acc + element })
val resultTrailing = numbers.fold(0) { acc, element -> acc + element }
```

**Key points:**

- Lambda syntax: `{ parameters -> body }`
- Use `it` for single parameter lambdas
- Trailing lambda syntax improves readability
- Last expression in lambda is automatically returned
- Type inference reduces boilerplate

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions. They enable powerful functional programming patterns.

#### Functions Taking Function Parameters

```kotlin
// Function accepting lambda parameter
fun processNumbers(numbers: List<Int>, operation: (Int) -> Int): List<Int> {
    return numbers.map(operation)
}

// Usage
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val squared = processNumbers(numbers) { it * it }
val doubled = processNumbers(numbers) { it * 2 }

// Function with multiple function parameters
fun combineOperations(
    numbers: List<Int>,
    filter: (Int) -> Boolean,
    transform: (Int) -> Int
): List<Int> {
    return numbers.filter(filter).map(transform)
}

val result = combineOperations(
    numbers,
    { it % 2 == 0 }, // Filter even numbers
    { it * 10 }      // Multiply by 10
)
```

#### Functions Returning Functions

```kotlin
// Function returning a function
fun createMultiplier(factor: Int): (Int) -> Int {
    return { number -> number * factor }
}

val doubler = createMultiplier(2)
val tripler = createMultiplier(3)

val doubled = doubler(5) // Returns 10
val tripled = tripler(5) // Returns 15

// More complex function factory
fun createValidator(minLength: Int, maxLength: Int): (String) -> Boolean {
    return { text ->
        text.length >= minLength && text.length <= maxLength
    }
}

val passwordValidator = createValidator(8, 20)
val isValidPassword = passwordValidator("myPassword123") // Returns true
```

#### Built-in Higher-Order Functions

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

// Collection operations
val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
val squaredNumbers = numbers.map { it * it }
val sum = numbers.reduce { acc, n -> acc + n }
val product = numbers.fold(1) { acc, n -> acc * n }

// String operations
val text = "Hello, World!"
val processedText = text
    .filter { it.isLetter() }
    .map { it.uppercase() }
    .joinToString("")

// Scope functions
val person = Person("John", 25).apply {
    age = 26
    println("Updated age to $age")
}

val result = listOf(1, 2, 3).let { numbers ->
    numbers.map { it * 2 }.sum()
}
```

#### Custom Higher-Order Functions

```kotlin
// Retry mechanism
fun <T> retry(
    times: Int,
    operation: () -> T,
    onFailure: (Exception) -> Unit = {}
): T? {
    repeat(times) {
        try {
            return operation()
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            onFailure(e)
            if (it == times - 1) throw e
        }
    }
    return null
}

// Usage
val result = retry(3, 
    operation = { 
        // Some operation that might fail
        if (Math.random() > 0.7) "Success" else throw RuntimeException("Failed")
    },
    onFailure = { exception ->
        println("Attempt failed: ${exception.message}")
    }
)

// Timing function
fun <T> measureTime(operation: () -> T): Pair<T, Long> {
    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    val result = operation()
    val endTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    return result to (endTime - startTime)
}

val (data, duration) = measureTime {
    (1..1000000).map { it * it }.sum()
}
```

**Key points:**

- Higher-order functions accept functions as parameters or return functions
- They enable code reuse and abstraction
- Built-in functions like `map`, `filter`, `fold` are higher-order functions
- Custom higher-order functions can encapsulate common patterns

### Function Types and Function Literals

Kotlin has a rich type system for functions, allowing them to be treated as first-class citizens.

#### Function Type Syntax

```kotlin
// Basic function types
val intToString: (Int) -> String = { it.toString() }
val twoIntsToInt: (Int, Int) -> Int = { x, y -> x + y }
val noParamsToUnit: () -> Unit = { println("Hello") }

// Function type with receiver
val stringExtension: String.() -> Int = { this.length }
val stringLength = "Hello".stringExtension() // Returns 5

// Nullable function types
val nullableFunction: ((Int) -> String)? = null
val safeCall = nullableFunction?.invoke(42)

// Function type with nullable return
val maybeInt: () -> Int? = { if (Math.random() > 0.5) 42 else null }
```

#### Function Type Parameters

```kotlin
// Function accepting function type parameter
fun applyOperation(x: Int, y: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(x, y)
}

// Different ways to pass function arguments
val result1 = applyOperation(5, 3, { x, y -> x + y })
val result2 = applyOperation(5, 3) { x, y -> x * y }
val result3 = applyOperation(5, 3, Int::plus) // Method reference

// Higher-order function with multiple function parameters
fun processData(
    data: List<Int>,
    validator: (Int) -> Boolean,
    transformer: (Int) -> String,
    aggregator: (List<String>) -> String
): String {
    return data
        .filter(validator)
        .map(transformer)
        .let(aggregator)
}

val result = processData(
    data = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
    validator = { it > 2 },
    transformer = { "Number: $it" },
    aggregator = { it.joinToString(", ") }
)
```

#### Function References

```kotlin
// Top-level function reference
fun isEven(number: Int): Boolean = number % 2 == 0

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val evenNumbers = numbers.filter(::isEven)

// Member function reference
class Calculator {
    fun add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
    fun multiply(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x * y
}

val calc = Calculator()
val addFunction: (Int, Int) -> Int = calc::add
val multiplyFunction: (Int, Int) -> Int = calc::multiply

// Extension function reference
fun String.isPalindrome(): Boolean = this == this.reversed()
val palindromeChecker: (String) -> Boolean = String::isPalindrome

// Property reference
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
val people = listOf(Person("Alice", 25), Person("Bob", 30))
val names = people.map(Person::name)
val ages = people.map(Person::age)
```

#### Function Literals with Receivers

```kotlin
// Lambda with receiver
val stringBuilder: StringBuilder.() -> Unit = {
    append("Hello")
    append(" ")
    append("World")
}

val result = StringBuilder().apply(stringBuilder).toString()

// DSL-style usage
fun html(init: StringBuilder.() -> Unit): String {
    val sb = StringBuilder()
    sb.init()
    return sb.toString()
}

val htmlContent = html {
    append("<html>")
    append("<body>")
    append("Hello, World!")
    append("</body>")
    append("</html>")
}
```

**Key points:**

- Function types use `(ParamTypes) -> ReturnType` syntax
- Function types can be nullable, have receivers, or return nullable types
- Function references provide a way to reference existing functions
- Function literals with receivers enable DSL creation

### Closures and Capturing Variables

Closures are lambda expressions that capture variables from their surrounding scope, creating powerful and flexible programming patterns.

#### Variable Capture

```kotlin
// Capturing local variables
fun createCounter(): () -> Int {
    var count = 0
    return {
        count++
        count
    }
}

val counter = createCounter()
println(counter()) // 1
println(counter()) // 2
println(counter()) // 3

// Capturing multiple variables
fun createAccumulator(initial: Int): (Int) -> Int {
    var accumulator = initial
    return { value ->
        accumulator += value
        accumulator
    }
}

val acc = createAccumulator(10)
println(acc(5)) // 15
println(acc(3)) // 18
```

#### Modifying Captured Variables

```kotlin
// Mutable variable capture
fun demonstrateCapture() {
    var capturedVariable = 0
    
    val incrementer = {
        capturedVariable++
        println("Incremented to: $capturedVariable")
    }
    
    val doubler = {
        capturedVariable *= 2
        println("Doubled to: $capturedVariable")
    }
    
    incrementer() // Incremented to: 1
    doubler()     // Doubled to: 2
    incrementer() // Incremented to: 3
}

// Capturing in loops
fun createMultipleFunctions(): List<() -> Int> {
    val functions = mutableListOf<() -> Int>()
    
    for (i in 1..5) {
        // Each lambda captures its own copy of i
        functions.add { i * i }
    }
    
    return functions
}

val squareFunctions = createMultipleFunctions()
squareFunctions.forEach { println(it()) } // 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
```

#### Closure Patterns

```kotlin
// Memoization using closures
fun <T, R> memoize(fn: (T) -> R): (T) -> R {
    val cache = mutableMapOf<T, R>()
    return { input ->
        cache.getOrPut(input) { fn(input) }
    }
}

val expensiveOperation = { x: Int ->
    Thread.sleep(1000) // Simulate expensive operation
    x * x
}

val memoizedOperation = memoize(expensiveOperation)
println(memoizedOperation(5)) // Takes 1 second, returns 25
println(memoizedOperation(5)) // Returns immediately, returns 25

// Event handling with closures
class EventManager {
    private val handlers = mutableListOf<() -> Unit>()
    
    fun addHandler(handler: () -> Unit) {
        handlers.add(handler)
    }
    
    fun triggerEvent() {
        handlers.forEach { it() }
    }
}

fun setupEventHandlers() {
    val eventManager = EventManager()
    var clickCount = 0
    var lastClickTime = 0L
    
    eventManager.addHandler {
        clickCount++
        lastClickTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
        println("Click #$clickCount at $lastClickTime")
    }
    
    eventManager.addHandler {
        if (clickCount > 5) {
            println("Too many clicks!")
        }
    }
    
    // Trigger events
    repeat(7) {
        eventManager.triggerEvent()
        Thread.sleep(100)
    }
}
```

#### Closure Scope and Lifecycle

```kotlin
// Understanding closure lifecycle
class ClosureExample {
    private var instanceVariable = "Instance"
    
    fun createClosure(): () -> String {
        val localVariable = "Local"
        var mutableLocal = 0
        
        return {
            mutableLocal++
            "Instance: $instanceVariable, Local: $localVariable, Count: $mutableLocal"
        }
    }
    
    fun demonstrateScope() {
        val closure1 = createClosure()
        val closure2 = createClosure()
        
        println(closure1()) // Instance: Instance, Local: Local, Count: 1
        println(closure1()) // Instance: Instance, Local: Local, Count: 2
        println(closure2()) // Instance: Instance, Local: Local, Count: 1
        
        instanceVariable = "Modified"
        println(closure1()) // Instance: Modified, Local: Local, Count: 3
    }
}

// Avoiding memory leaks with closures
class ResourceManager {
    private val resources = mutableListOf<String>()
    
    fun createProcessor(): (String) -> String {
        return { input ->
            // Be careful about capturing 'this' - it keeps the entire object alive
            processResource(input)
        }
    }
    
    private fun processResource(resource: String): String {
        return "Processed: $resource"
    }
}
```

#### Practical Closure Examples

```kotlin
// Configuration builder using closures
class DatabaseConfig {
    var host: String = "localhost"
    var port: Int = 5432
    var username: String = "user"
    var password: String = "password"
    
    fun configure(block: DatabaseConfig.() -> Unit) {
        this.block()
    }
}

fun createDatabaseConnection(config: DatabaseConfig.() -> Unit): DatabaseConfig {
    val dbConfig = DatabaseConfig()
    dbConfig.config()
    return dbConfig
}

val dbConfig = createDatabaseConnection {
    host = "production.db.com"
    port = 3306
    username = "admin"
    password = "secret123"
}

// Partial application using closures
fun <A, B, C> partial(fn: (A, B) -> C, a: A): (B) -> C {
    return { b -> fn(a, b) }
}

val multiply = { x: Int, y: Int -> x * y }
val multiplyByTwo = partial(multiply, 2)
val multiplyByTen = partial(multiply, 10)

println(multiplyByTwo(5))  // 10
println(multiplyByTen(5))  // 50
```

**Key points:**

- Closures capture variables from their surrounding scope
- Captured variables maintain their state between invocations
- Each closure instance has its own copy of captured variables
- Closures can modify captured mutable variables
- Be mindful of memory implications when capturing large objects

**Example:**

```kotlin
// Comprehensive example: Task scheduler with closures
class TaskScheduler {
    private val tasks = mutableListOf<() -> Unit>()
    
    fun schedule(delay: Long, task: () -> Unit) {
        val scheduledTask = {
            Thread.sleep(delay)
            task()
        }
        tasks.add(scheduledTask)
    }
    
    fun executeTasks() {
        tasks.forEach { it() }
        tasks.clear()
    }
}

fun main() {
    val scheduler = TaskScheduler()
    var taskCount = 0
    
    // Schedule tasks that capture and modify local variables
    repeat(3) { index ->
        scheduler.schedule(1000 * (index + 1)) {
            taskCount++
            println("Task $index executed (total: $taskCount)")
        }
    }
    
    // Create a closure that captures a complex state
    val messageBuilder = StringBuilder()
    val messageTask = {
        messageBuilder.append("Task completed at ${System.currentTimeMillis()}\n")
        println(messageBuilder.toString())
    }
    
    scheduler.schedule(2000, messageTask)
    scheduler.executeTasks()
}
```

**Output:**

```
Task 0 executed (total: 1)
Task 1 executed (total: 2)
Task completed at 1703123456789

Task 2 executed (total: 3)
```

Lambda expressions and closures are fundamental to Kotlin's functional programming capabilities, enabling elegant solutions to complex problems through function composition and state capture.

## Functional Operations

### Collection Processing with Lambdas

Kotlin provides extensive functional programming capabilities for collection manipulation through higher-order functions and lambda expressions.

#### Basic Collection Operations

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

// Transform elements
val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }  // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
val strings = numbers.map { "Number: $it" }

// Filter elements
val evens = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }  // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
val greaterThanFive = numbers.filter { it > 5 }  // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

// Reduce and fold operations
val sum = numbers.reduce { acc, n -> acc + n }  // 55
val product = numbers.fold(1) { acc, n -> acc * n }  // 3628800
```

#### Advanced Collection Operations

```kotlin
val people = listOf(
    Person("Alice", 30),
    Person("Bob", 25),
    Person("Charlie", 35),
    Person("Diana", 28)
)

// Group by criteria
val groupedByAge = people.groupBy { it.age >= 30 }
val groupedByFirstLetter = people.groupBy { it.name.first() }

// Partition into two groups
val (adults, young) = people.partition { it.age >= 30 }

// Sort operations
val sortedByAge = people.sortedBy { it.age }
val sortedByName = people.sortedWith(compareBy { it.name })

// Find operations
val firstAdult = people.find { it.age >= 30 }  // Alice
val allAdults = people.all { it.age >= 18 }    // true
val anyTeenager = people.any { it.age < 18 }   // false
```

#### Chaining Operations

```kotlin
val result = numbers
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    .map { it * it }
    .sortedDescending()
    .take(3)
    .sum()  // Sum of squares of top 3 even numbers

// Complex processing pipeline
val processedData = people
    .filter { it.age >= 25 }
    .sortedBy { it.name }
    .map { "${it.name} (${it.age})" }
    .joinToString(", ")
```

#### Working with Nested Collections

```kotlin
val departments = listOf(
    Department("IT", listOf(
        Employee("Alice", 30),
        Employee("Bob", 25)
    )),
    Department("HR", listOf(
        Employee("Charlie", 35),
        Employee("Diana", 28)
    ))
)

// Flatten nested collections
val allEmployees = departments.flatMap { it.employees }
val allNames = departments.flatMap { dept -> 
    dept.employees.map { it.name }
}

// Associate operations
val employeesByDept = departments.associate { it.name to it.employees }
val employeeAges = allEmployees.associate { it.name to it.age }
```

**Key points:**

- Lambda expressions provide concise syntax for functional operations
- Operations can be chained for complex data processing pipelines
- `it` refers to the current element in single-parameter lambdas
- Collection operations are eager by default (process immediately)

### Scope Functions

Scope functions execute code blocks within the context of an object, each with different characteristics and use cases.

#### `let` Function

`let` executes a block with the object as parameter and returns the block result.

```kotlin
// Basic usage
val name: String? = "Kotlin"
val length = name?.let { it.length } ?: 0

// Chaining operations
val result = "Hello World"
    .let { it.uppercase() }
    .let { it.replace(" ", "_") }
    .let { "PREFIX_$it" }  // "PREFIX_HELLO_WORLD"

// Null safety
fun processString(str: String?) {
    str?.let { nonNullString ->
        println("Processing: $nonNullString")
        // Additional processing
    }
}
```

#### `run` Function

`run` executes a block in the context of the object and returns the block result.

```kotlin
// Object context
val person = Person("Alice", 30)
val info = person.run {
    "Name: $name, Age: $age, Adult: ${age >= 18}"
}

// Without object context
val result = run {
    val x = 10
    val y = 20
    x + y  // Returns 30
}

// Configuration and initialization
class DatabaseConfig {
    var host = ""
    var port = 0
    var database = ""
}

val config = DatabaseConfig().run {
    host = "localhost"
    port = 5432
    database = "myapp"
    this  // Return configured object
}
```

#### `with` Function

`with` executes a block with the object as receiver and returns the block result.

```kotlin
val person = Person("Bob", 25)
val description = with(person) {
    "Person details: $name is $age years old"
}

// Multiple operations on same object
val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
val result = with(stringBuilder) {
    append("Hello")
    append(" ")
    append("World")
    toString()
}

// Canvas drawing example
with(canvas) {
    drawRect(0f, 0f, 100f, 100f, paint)
    drawCircle(50f, 50f, 25f, paint)
    drawText("Hello", 10f, 90f, textPaint)
}
```

#### `apply` Function

`apply` executes a block in the context of the object and returns the object itself.

```kotlin
// Object configuration
val person = Person("Charlie", 35).apply {
    email = "charlie@example.com"
    phone = "123-456-7890"
}

// Builder pattern
val textView = TextView(context).apply {
    text = "Hello World"
    textSize = 16f
    setTextColor(Color.BLUE)
    gravity = Gravity.CENTER
}

// File operations
val file = File("data.txt").apply {
    createNewFile()
    writeText("Initial content")
}
```

#### `also` Function

`also` executes a block with the object as parameter and returns the object itself.

```kotlin
// Logging and debugging
val numbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
    .also { println("Initial list: $it") }
    .apply { add(4) }
    .also { println("After adding 4: $it") }
    .apply { removeAt(0) }
    .also { println("After removing first: $it") }

// Side effects
fun processData(data: String): String {
    return data
        .trim()
        .also { println("Trimmed: '$it'") }
        .uppercase()
        .also { println("Uppercase: '$it'") }
        .replace(" ", "_")
        .also { println("Final: '$it'") }
}
```

#### Scope Function Comparison

```kotlin
// Choosing the right scope function
val person = Person("Diana", 28)

// let - null safety, transformations
val nameLength = person.name?.let { it.length }

// run - object context, complex calculations
val isAdult = person.run { age >= 18 }

// with - multiple operations, no null safety
val info = with(person) { "$name ($age)" }

// apply - object configuration, fluent interface
val configuredPerson = person.apply { 
    email = "diana@example.com" 
}

// also - side effects, debugging
val processedPerson = person.also { 
    println("Processing: ${it.name}") 
}
```

**Key points:**

- `let` and `also` pass object as lambda parameter (`it`)
- `run`, `with`, and `apply` make object available as receiver (`this`)
- `let`, `run`, and `with` return lambda result
- `apply` and `also` return the original object
- Use for null safety, configuration, side effects, and transformations

### Sequence API for Lazy Evaluation

Sequences provide lazy evaluation for collection operations, processing elements on-demand rather than creating intermediate collections.

#### Creating Sequences

```kotlin
// From collections
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val sequence = numbers.asSequence()

// Generate sequences
val infiniteSequence = generateSequence(1) { it + 1 }
val fibonacciSequence = generateSequence(1 to 1) { (a, b) -> b to a + b }
    .map { it.first }

// Sequence builders
val customSequence = sequence {
    yield(1)
    yield(2)
    yieldAll(listOf(3, 4, 5))
    yield(6)
}
```

#### Lazy vs Eager Evaluation

```kotlin
val numbers = (1..1000000).toList()

// Eager evaluation - creates intermediate collections
val eagerResult = numbers
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    .map { it * it }
    .take(10)
    .toList()

// Lazy evaluation - processes elements on-demand
val lazyResult = numbers
    .asSequence()
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    .map { it * it }
    .take(10)
    .toList()
```

#### Sequence Operations

```kotlin
val largeDataset = (1..100000).asSequence()

// Terminal operations trigger evaluation
val result = largeDataset
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    .map { it * it }
    .take(10)
    .sum()  // Terminal operation

// Working with infinite sequences
val primes = generateSequence(2) { it + 1 }
    .filter { candidate ->
        (2 until candidate).none { candidate % it == 0 }
    }
    .take(10)
    .toList()
```

#### Performance Considerations

```kotlin
// Sequence performance benefits
fun performanceComparison() {
    val data = (1..10000).toList()
    
    // Multiple intermediate collections
    val listResult = data
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .map { it * it }
        .filter { it > 100 }
        .take(100)
    
    // Single pass through data
    val sequenceResult = data.asSequence()
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .map { it * it }
        .filter { it > 100 }
        .take(100)
        .toList()
}
```

**Key points:**

- Sequences process elements lazily, one at a time
- Intermediate operations are not executed until terminal operation
- More memory efficient for large datasets
- Ideal for processing pipelines with multiple transformations
- Use `asSequence()` for collections, `generateSequence()` for infinite sequences

### Function Composition Techniques

Function composition combines simple functions to create more complex operations.

#### Higher-Order Functions

```kotlin
// Function that takes another function as parameter
fun processNumbers(numbers: List<Int>, operation: (Int) -> Int): List<Int> {
    return numbers.map(operation)
}

// Function that returns another function
fun createMultiplier(factor: Int): (Int) -> Int {
    return { it * factor }
}

// Usage
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val doubled = processNumbers(numbers, createMultiplier(2))
```

#### Function Composition Operators

```kotlin
// Composition using infix functions
infix fun <A, B, C> ((B) -> C).compose(f: (A) -> B): (A) -> C {
    return { a -> this(f(a)) }
}

infix fun <A, B, C> ((A) -> B).andThen(f: (B) -> C): (A) -> C {
    return { a -> f(this(a)) }
}

// Usage
val addOne: (Int) -> Int = { it + 1 }
val multiplyByTwo: (Int) -> Int = { it * 2 }
val square: (Int) -> Int = { it * it }

val composed = addOne andThen multiplyByTwo andThen square
val result = composed(3)  // ((3 + 1) * 2)^2 = 64
```

#### Currying and Partial Application

```kotlin
// Currying - converting multi-parameter function to chain of single-parameter functions
fun add(a: Int): (Int) -> Int = { b -> a + b }
fun multiply(a: Int): (Int) -> Int = { b -> a * b }

// Partial application
fun partiallyApply2<A, B, C>(f: (A, B) -> C, a: A): (B) -> C {
    return { b -> f(a, b) }
}

// Usage
val add5 = add(5)
val multiply3 = multiply(3)

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val results = numbers.map(add5).map(multiply3)  // [18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
```

#### Pipeline Operations

```kotlin
// Pipeline operator
infix fun <T, R> T.pipe(f: (T) -> R): R = f(this)

// Usage
val result = "hello world"
    .pipe { it.uppercase() }
    .pipe { it.replace(" ", "_") }
    .pipe { "PREFIX_$it" }

// Complex data processing pipeline
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int, val email: String)

fun processUsers(users: List<User>): List<String> {
    return users
        .pipe { it.filter { user -> user.age >= 18 } }
        .pipe { it.sortedBy { user -> user.name } }
        .pipe { it.map { user -> "${user.name} <${user.email}>" } }
}
```

#### Functional Builders

```kotlin
// DSL for building processing pipelines
class ProcessingPipeline<T, R> {
    private val steps = mutableListOf<(Any) -> Any>()
    
    fun <U> map(transform: (T) -> U): ProcessingPipeline<T, U> {
        steps.add(transform as (Any) -> Any)
        return this as ProcessingPipeline<T, U>
    }
    
    fun filter(predicate: (T) -> Boolean): ProcessingPipeline<T, T> {
        steps.add { list -> (list as List<T>).filter(predicate) }
        return this
    }
    
    fun execute(input: T): R {
        return steps.fold(input as Any) { acc, step -> step(acc) } as R
    }
}

// Usage
val pipeline = ProcessingPipeline<List<Int>, List<String>>()
    .filter { it > 5 }
    .map { it * 2 }
    .map { "Result: $it" }

val result = pipeline.execute(listOf(1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 9))
```

#### Memoization

```kotlin
// Memoization for expensive computations
class Memoized<A, B>(val f: (A) -> B) : (A) -> B {
    private val cache = mutableMapOf<A, B>()
    
    override fun invoke(a: A): B {
        return cache.getOrPut(a) { f(a) }
    }
}

fun <A, B> ((A) -> B).memoized(): (A) -> B = Memoized(this)

// Usage
val expensiveFunction: (Int) -> Int = { n ->
    println("Computing for $n")
    Thread.sleep(1000)  // Simulate expensive computation
    n * n
}

val memoizedFunction = expensiveFunction.memoized()
println(memoizedFunction(5))  // Takes 1 second, prints "Computing for 5"
println(memoizedFunction(5))  // Instant, uses cached result
```

**Key points:**

- Function composition creates complex behavior from simple functions
- Higher-order functions enable flexible and reusable code
- Currying and partial application allow function specialization
- Pipeline operations improve code readability
- Memoization optimizes expensive computations through caching

**Related topics:** Coroutines and asynchronous programming, type-safe builders, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and advanced generics leverage these functional programming concepts.

# Advanced Language Features

## Generics

### Generic Functions and Classes

Generics enable writing type-safe, reusable code that works with multiple types while maintaining compile-time type checking.

```kotlin
// Generic function
fun <T> swap(a: T, b: T): Pair<T, T> {
    return Pair(b, a)
}

// Usage
val swapped = swap(10, 20) // Type inferred as Pair<Int, Int>
val swappedStrings = swap("hello", "world") // Type inferred as Pair<String, String>

// Generic function with multiple type parameters
fun <T, R> transform(input: T, transformer: (T) -> R): R {
    return transformer(input)
}

val result = transform(42) { it.toString() } // String
val doubled = transform(5) { it * 2 } // Int

// Generic class
class Box<T>(private var value: T) {
    fun get(): T = value
    fun set(newValue: T) {
        value = newValue
    }
    
    fun <R> map(transform: (T) -> R): Box<R> {
        return Box(transform(value))
    }
}

// Usage
val intBox = Box(42)
val stringBox = intBox.map { it.toString() }
val doubledBox = intBox.map { it * 2 }

// Generic class with multiple type parameters
class Pair<T, U>(val first: T, val second: U) {
    fun <R> mapFirst(transform: (T) -> R): Pair<R, U> {
        return Pair(transform(first), second)
    }
    
    fun <R> mapSecond(transform: (U) -> R): Pair<T, R> {
        return Pair(first, transform(second))
    }
}

// Generic interface
interface Repository<T> {
    fun save(item: T)
    fun findById(id: String): T?
    fun findAll(): List<T>
    fun delete(id: String): Boolean
}

// Implementation
class UserRepository : Repository<User> {
    private val users = mutableMapOf<String, User>()
    
    override fun save(item: User) {
        users[item.id] = item
    }
    
    override fun findById(id: String): User? = users[id]
    override fun findAll(): List<User> = users.values.toList()
    override fun delete(id: String): Boolean = users.remove(id) != null
}

// Generic with nested classes
class Container<T> {
    private val items = mutableListOf<T>()
    
    fun add(item: T) {
        items.add(item)
    }
    
    inner class Iterator {
        private var index = 0
        
        fun hasNext(): Boolean = index < items.size
        fun next(): T = items[index++]
    }
    
    fun iterator(): Iterator = Iterator()
}
```

**Key points:**

- Generic functions use `<T>` syntax before function name
- Type parameters can be inferred from usage
- Generic classes can have multiple type parameters
- Generic methods can be defined within non-generic classes
- Inner classes have access to outer class's type parameters

### Type Parameters and Constraints

Type constraints limit which types can be used as generic arguments, ensuring type safety and enabling specific operations.

```kotlin
// Upper bound constraint
fun <T : Number> sum(a: T, b: T): Double {
    return a.toDouble() + b.toDouble()
}

// Multiple constraints
interface Printable {
    fun print()
}

fun <T> processItem(item: T) where T : Comparable<T>, T : Printable {
    item.print()
    // Can use Comparable methods
}

// Generic class with constraints
class SortedList<T : Comparable<T>> {
    private val items = mutableListOf<T>()
    
    fun add(item: T) {
        val index = items.binarySearch(item)
        val insertionPoint = if (index >= 0) index else -index - 1
        items.add(insertionPoint, item)
    }
    
    fun get(index: Int): T = items[index]
    fun size(): Int = items.size
}

// Generic constraints with multiple bounds
interface Named {
    val name: String
}

interface Identifiable {
    val id: String
}

class EntityProcessor<T> where T : Named, T : Identifiable {
    fun process(entity: T) {
        println("Processing entity: ${entity.name} (ID: ${entity.id})")
    }
}

// Star projection for unknown types
class Container<T>(private val items: MutableList<T>) {
    fun getItems(): List<T> = items.toList()
    
    // Function that works with any Container
    fun copyFrom(other: Container<*>) {
        // Can only read from other, not write
        println("Copying ${other.getItems().size} items")
    }
}

// Generic constraints with nullable types
class NullableContainer<T : Any?> {
    private var value: T? = null
    
    fun set(newValue: T?) {
        value = newValue
    }
    
    fun get(): T? = value
}

// Generic constraints with sealed classes
sealed class Result<out T>
data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
data class Error(val message: String) : Result<Nothing>()

fun <T : Any> processResult(result: Result<T>) {
    when (result) {
        is Success -> println("Success: ${result.data}")
        is Error -> println("Error: ${result.message}")
    }
}

// Generic with enum constraints
enum class Status { ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING }

class StatusManager<T : Enum<T>>(private val enumClass: Class<T>) {
    fun getAllStatuses(): Array<T> = enumClass.enumConstants
    
    fun isValid(status: String): Boolean {
        return try {
            java.lang.Enum.valueOf(enumClass, status)
            true
        } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
            false
        }
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Upper bounds specified with `:` syntax
- Multiple constraints use `where` clause
- `Any` constraint excludes nullable types
- Star projection (`*`) for unknown types with read-only access
- Constraints enable calling specific methods on type parameters
- Sealed classes work well with generic constraints

### Variance

Variance defines how generic types with inheritance relationships relate to each other.

```kotlin
// Covariance - producer (out)
interface Producer<out T> {
    fun produce(): T
    // Cannot have T as parameter type
}

class AnimalProducer : Producer<Animal> {
    override fun produce(): Animal = Animal("Generic Animal")
}

class DogProducer : Producer<Dog> {
    override fun produce(): Dog = Dog("Buddy")
}

// Covariance allows assignment
val animalProducer: Producer<Animal> = DogProducer() // OK
val animal = animalProducer.produce() // Returns Dog, treated as Animal

// Contravariance - consumer (in)
interface Consumer<in T> {
    fun consume(item: T)
    // Cannot have T as return type
}

class AnimalConsumer : Consumer<Animal> {
    override fun consume(item: Animal) {
        println("Consuming animal: ${item.name}")
    }
}

// Contravariance allows assignment
val dogConsumer: Consumer<Dog> = AnimalConsumer() // OK
dogConsumer.consume(Dog("Rex")) // Animal consumer can handle Dog

// Invariance - both producer and consumer
interface Storage<T> {
    fun store(item: T)
    fun retrieve(): T
}

// Built-in variance examples
val strings: List<String> = listOf("a", "b", "c")
val objects: List<Any> = strings // OK - List is covariant

val mutableStrings: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("a", "b")
// val mutableObjects: MutableList<Any> = mutableStrings // ERROR - MutableList is invariant

// Use-site variance
fun copyFrom(source: Array<out Any>, dest: Array<in Any>) {
    for (i in source.indices) {
        dest[i] = source[i]
    }
}

// Generic variance in practice
class Box<T>(private var value: T) {
    fun get(): T = value
    fun set(newValue: T) {
        value = newValue
    }
}

// Variance with functions
fun processProducers(producers: List<Producer<out Animal>>) {
    producers.forEach { producer ->
        val animal = producer.produce()
        println("Produced: ${animal.name}")
    }
}

fun processConsumers(consumers: List<Consumer<in Dog>>) {
    val dog = Dog("Max")
    consumers.forEach { consumer ->
        consumer.consume(dog)
    }
}

// Complex variance scenarios
interface Transformer<in T, out R> {
    fun transform(input: T): R
}

class StringToIntTransformer : Transformer<String, Int> {
    override fun transform(input: String): Int = input.length
}

// Variance with nullable types
class NullableProducer<out T : Any?> {
    fun produce(): T? = null
}

// Variance with collections
fun <T> copyList(source: List<out T>, destination: MutableList<in T>) {
    for (item in source) {
        destination.add(item)
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Covariance (`out`) allows subtype assignments for producers
- Contravariance (`in`) allows supertype assignments for consumers
- Invariance requires exact type match
- Use-site variance with `out` and `in` at call site
- Collections demonstrate variance principles
- Variance enables flexible API design

### Generic Type Erasure and Reified Types

Type erasure removes generic type information at runtime, but reified types in inline functions preserve this information.

```kotlin
// Type erasure problem
fun <T> isOfType(value: Any): Boolean {
    // return value is T // ERROR - cannot check erased type
    return false
}

// Reified types solution
inline fun <reified T> isOfType(value: Any): Boolean {
    return value is T
}

// Usage
val number = 42
val isInt = isOfType<Int>(number) // true
val isString = isOfType<String>(number) // false

// Reified types with class access
inline fun <reified T> createInstance(): T? {
    return try {
        T::class.java.newInstance()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        null
    }
}

// Reified types with reflection
inline fun <reified T> getClassName(): String {
    return T::class.simpleName ?: "Unknown"
}

// Complex reified type usage
inline fun <reified T> filterByType(items: List<Any>): List<T> {
    return items.filterIsInstance<T>()
}

val mixedList = listOf(1, "hello", 2.5, "world", 42)
val strings = filterByType<String>(mixedList) // ["hello", "world"]
val numbers = filterByType<Int>(mixedList) // [1, 42]

// Reified types with JSON parsing
inline fun <reified T> parseJson(json: String): T? {
    return try {
        // Gson example (hypothetical)
        Gson().fromJson(json, T::class.java)
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        null
    }
}

// Generic array creation with reified types
inline fun <reified T> createArray(size: Int): Array<T?> {
    return arrayOfNulls<T>(size)
}

// Type erasure workarounds without reified
class TypeToken<T> {
    val type: Class<T>
    
    @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
    constructor() {
        val superclass = javaClass.genericSuperclass as ParameterizedType
        type = superclass.actualTypeArguments[0] as Class<T>
    }
}

// Usage with TypeToken
fun <T> createWithTypeToken(typeToken: TypeToken<T>): T? {
    return try {
        typeToken.type.newInstance()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        null
    }
}

// Star projection with type erasure
fun printContainerInfo(container: Container<*>) {
    println("Container has ${container.size()} items")
    // Cannot access specific type information
}

// Reified types with higher-order functions
inline fun <reified T> Collection<*>.countOfType(): Int {
    return count { it is T }
}

val items = listOf(1, "hello", 2.5, "world", 42, true)
val stringCount = items.countOfType<String>() // 2
val intCount = items.countOfType<Int>() // 2

// Reified types with sealed classes
sealed class ApiResponse<out T>
data class Success<T>(val data: T) : ApiResponse<T>()
data class Error(val message: String) : ApiResponse<Nothing>()

inline fun <reified T> handleResponse(response: ApiResponse<*>): T? {
    return when (response) {
        is Success -> {
            if (response.data is T) response.data else null
        }
        is Error -> {
            println("Error: ${response.message}")
            null
        }
    }
}

// Runtime type information preservation
inline fun <reified T> analyzeType() {
    val clazz = T::class
    println("Type: ${clazz.simpleName}")
    println("Is data class: ${clazz.isData}")
    println("Is sealed: ${clazz.isSealed}")
    println("Constructors: ${clazz.constructors.size}")
}
```

**Key points:**

- Type erasure removes generic type info at runtime
- Reified types preserve type information in inline functions
- `reified` keyword enables runtime type checking
- Reified types enable generic array creation
- TypeToken pattern works around type erasure
- Star projection handles unknown types safely
- Reified types are limited to inline functions

### Advanced Generic Patterns

```kotlin
// Generic builder pattern
class QueryBuilder<T> {
    private val conditions = mutableListOf<String>()
    
    fun where(condition: String): QueryBuilder<T> {
        conditions.add(condition)
        return this
    }
    
    fun and(condition: String): QueryBuilder<T> {
        conditions.add("AND $condition")
        return this
    }
    
    fun build(): Query<T> {
        return Query(conditions.joinToString(" "))
    }
}

class Query<T>(val sql: String)

// Generic factory pattern
interface Factory<T> {
    fun create(): T
}

class DatabaseFactory<T>(private val creator: () -> T) : Factory<T> {
    override fun create(): T = creator()
}

// Generic visitor pattern
interface Visitor<T, R> {
    fun visit(item: T): R
}

class PrintVisitor : Visitor<Any, String> {
    override fun visit(item: Any): String = item.toString()
}

// Generic with delegation
class LazyValue<T>(private val initializer: () -> T) {
    private var value: T? = null
    
    fun get(): T {
        if (value == null) {
            value = initializer()
        }
        return value!!
    }
}

// Generic monad pattern
class Optional<T>(private val value: T?) {
    fun <R> map(transform: (T) -> R): Optional<R> {
        return if (value != null) {
            Optional(transform(value))
        } else {
            Optional(null)
        }
    }
    
    fun <R> flatMap(transform: (T) -> Optional<R>): Optional<R> {
        return if (value != null) {
            transform(value)
        } else {
            Optional(null)
        }
    }
    
    fun getOrElse(default: T): T = value ?: default
}

// Generic type-safe builders
class HtmlBuilder<T> {
    private val elements = mutableListOf<String>()
    
    fun tag(name: String, content: String): HtmlBuilder<T> {
        elements.add("<$name>$content</$name>")
        return this
    }
    
    fun build(): String = elements.joinToString("\n")
}

inline fun <reified T> html(block: HtmlBuilder<T>.() -> Unit): String {
    return HtmlBuilder<T>().apply(block).build()
}
```

**Key points:**

- Generic builders provide type-safe construction
- Factory pattern with generics enables flexible object creation
- Visitor pattern with generics supports type-safe operations
- Delegation with generics enables lazy evaluation
- Monad pattern with generics provides functional composition
- Type-safe builders combine generics with DSL patterns

## Delegation and Properties

### Property Delegation

Kotlin's property delegation mechanism allows you to delegate the implementation of property getters and setters to another object using the `by` keyword. This powerful feature enables code reuse and separation of concerns by extracting common property behavior into reusable delegates.

The syntax for property delegation is straightforward:

```kotlin
class Example {
    var p: String by Delegate()
}
```

When you delegate a property, Kotlin generates code that calls the delegate's `getValue()` and `setValue()` methods (for var properties) or just `getValue()` (for val properties). The delegate must implement the appropriate operator functions.

### Built-in Delegates

#### Lazy Properties

Lazy properties are computed only on first access and then cached for subsequent calls. This is particularly useful for expensive computations or when you want to defer initialization until actually needed.

```kotlin
class DataProcessor {
    val expensiveData: List<String> by lazy {
        println("Computing expensive data...")
        // Simulate expensive computation
        Thread.sleep(1000)
        listOf("data1", "data2", "data3")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val processor = DataProcessor()
    println("Processor created")
    println(processor.expensiveData) // Computation happens here
    println(processor.expensiveData) // Uses cached value
}
```

**Key points:**

- Lazy properties are thread-safe by default
- You can specify thread safety mode: `LazyThreadSafetyMode.SYNCHRONIZED`, `PUBLICATION`, or `NONE`
- The lambda is executed at most once

#### Observable Properties

Observable properties notify listeners when their value changes. This is useful for implementing reactive patterns or data binding.

```kotlin
import kotlin.properties.Delegates

class User {
    var name: String by Delegates.observable("Initial") { property, oldValue, newValue ->
        println("Property ${property.name} changed from $oldValue to $newValue")
    }
    
    var age: Int by Delegates.vetoable(0) { property, oldValue, newValue ->
        println("Attempting to change ${property.name} from $oldValue to $newValue")
        newValue >= 0 // Only allow non-negative ages
    }
}

fun main() {
    val user = User()
    user.name = "John" // Triggers observer
    user.age = 25      // Triggers vetoable, change allowed
    user.age = -5      // Triggers vetoable, change rejected
    println("Final age: ${user.age}")
}
```

#### NotNull Delegate

The `notNull()` delegate is useful when you need to initialize a property later but want to ensure it's not null when accessed.

```kotlin
class Configuration {
    var databaseUrl: String by Delegates.notNull()
    
    fun initialize() {
        databaseUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
    }
}
```

### Class Delegation

Class delegation allows a class to delegate the implementation of interfaces to another object. This provides a clean alternative to inheritance and enables composition-based design.

```kotlin
interface Printer {
    fun print(message: String)
}

class ConsolePrinter : Printer {
    override fun print(message: String) {
        println("Console: $message")
    }
}

class FilePrinter(private val filename: String) : Printer {
    override fun print(message: String) {
        println("File($filename): $message")
    }
}

class Logger(printer: Printer) : Printer by printer {
    fun logWithTimestamp(message: String) {
        val timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis()
        print("[$timestamp] $message")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val consoleLogger = Logger(ConsolePrinter())
    val fileLogger = Logger(FilePrinter("app.log"))
    
    consoleLogger.print("Hello World")
    fileLogger.logWithTimestamp("Application started")
}
```

**Key points:**

- Class delegation works with interfaces
- You can override specific methods while delegating others
- The delegated object is stored as a private field
- Multiple interfaces can be delegated to different objects

### Custom Property Delegates

You can create custom property delegates by implementing the `ReadOnlyProperty` interface (for val properties) or `ReadWriteProperty` interface (for var properties), or by providing operator functions.

#### Creating a Custom Delegate with Operator Functions

```kotlin
class LoggingDelegate<T>(private var value: T) {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): T {
        println("Getting value of ${property.name}: $value")
        return value
    }
    
    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, value: T) {
        println("Setting value of ${property.name} from ${this.value} to $value")
        this.value = value
    }
}

class Example {
    var data: String by LoggingDelegate("initial")
}

fun main() {
    val example = Example()
    println(example.data)
    example.data = "updated"
    println(example.data)
}
```

#### Map-based Delegates

Kotlin provides built-in support for delegating properties to Map objects, which is useful for dynamic property access or JSON-like data structures.

```kotlin
class Person(private val map: MutableMap<String, Any>) {
    var name: String by map
    var age: Int by map
    
    constructor(name: String, age: Int) : this(mutableMapOf(
        "name" to name,
        "age" to age
    ))
}

fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 30)
    println("Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}")
    
    person.name = "Bob"
    person.age = 25
    println("Updated - Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}")
}
```

### Advanced Delegate Patterns

#### Delegate Providers

For more complex scenarios, you can create delegate providers that create different delegates based on the property being delegated.

```kotlin
class ResourceDelegate<T>(private val key: String, private val defaultValue: T) {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): T {
        // Simulate resource loading
        return loadResource(key) ?: defaultValue
    }
    
    private fun loadResource(key: String): T? {
        // Simulate resource loading logic
        @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
        return when (key) {
            "username" -> "admin" as T
            "timeout" -> 30 as T
            else -> null
        }
    }
}

fun resource(key: String, defaultValue: String) = ResourceDelegate(key, defaultValue)
fun resource(key: String, defaultValue: Int) = ResourceDelegate(key, defaultValue)

class AppConfig {
    val username: String by resource("username", "guest")
    val timeout: Int by resource("timeout", 10)
}
```

#### Conditional Delegates

You can create delegates that behave differently based on conditions.

```kotlin
class ConditionalDelegate<T>(
    private val condition: () -> Boolean,
    private val trueDelegate: T,
    private val falseDelegate: T
) {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): T {
        return if (condition()) trueDelegate else falseDelegate
    }
}

class FeatureToggle {
    private var debugMode = false
    
    val logLevel: String by ConditionalDelegate(
        condition = { debugMode },
        trueDelegate = "DEBUG",
        falseDelegate = "INFO"
    )
    
    fun enableDebug() { debugMode = true }
    fun disableDebug() { debugMode = false }
}
```

### Property Delegates with Backing Fields

Sometimes you need to combine property delegates with custom logic while still maintaining a backing field.

```kotlin
class ValidatedProperty<T>(
    private var backingValue: T,
    private val validator: (T) -> Boolean
) {
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): T = backingValue
    
    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, value: T) {
        if (validator(value)) {
            backingValue = value
        } else {
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid value for ${property.name}: $value")
        }
    }
}

class BankAccount {
    var balance: Double by ValidatedProperty(0.0) { it >= 0 }
    
    fun deposit(amount: Double) {
        balance += amount
    }
    
    fun withdraw(amount: Double) {
        balance -= amount // May throw exception if result is negative
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

Property delegation introduces a small performance overhead due to the additional method calls. For performance-critical code, consider:

- Using lazy delegates only when the computation is genuinely expensive
- Avoiding excessive property access in tight loops
- Considering inline delegates for simple cases
- Profiling to determine if delegation overhead is significant

### Thread Safety

When implementing custom delegates, consider thread safety:

```kotlin
class ThreadSafeDelegate<T>(initialValue: T) {
    @Volatile
    private var value: T = initialValue
    
    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): T = value
    
    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, value: T) {
        this.value = value
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:** Kotlin's delegation mechanism provides a powerful way to implement common patterns like lazy initialization, property observation, and composition over inheritance. By understanding both built-in delegates and how to create custom ones, you can write more maintainable and reusable code while leveraging Kotlin's expressive syntax.

# Error Handling and Testing

## Exception Handling

### Try-Catch Expressions

Kotlin treats exception handling as expressions, meaning try-catch blocks can return values. This functional approach allows for more concise and expressive error handling compared to traditional statement-based systems.

```kotlin
val result = try {
    someRiskyOperation()
} catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
    "Invalid number format"
} catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
    "Invalid argument"
} finally {
    println("Cleanup operations")
}
```

The try expression evaluates to the last expression in the try block if no exception occurs, or the last expression in the matching catch block if an exception is caught. The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception occurs.

**Key points:**

- Try-catch can be used as expressions that return values
- Multiple catch blocks can handle different exception types
- The finally block is optional and always executes
- If no catch block matches the exception, it propagates up the call stack

### Exception Hierarchy

Kotlin's exception hierarchy mirrors Java's structure, with all exceptions inheriting from `Throwable`. The main distinction is between checked and unchecked exceptions, though Kotlin doesn't enforce checked exception handling at compile time.

```kotlin
// All exceptions inherit from Throwable
open class Throwable
├── Error (unchecked)
├── Exception
    ├── RuntimeException (unchecked)
    └── Other exceptions (checked in Java, but not enforced in Kotlin)
```

### Throwing Exceptions

Exceptions in Kotlin are thrown using the `throw` keyword. The throw expression has the type `Nothing`, which helps with type inference and control flow analysis.

```kotlin
fun validateAge(age: Int): Int {
    if (age < 0) {
        throw IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative")
    }
    return age
}

// Using throw as an expression
val age = input.toIntOrNull() ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid age format")

// Multiple validation checks
fun processUser(name: String?, age: Int?) {
    val validName = name ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("Name is required")
    val validAge = age?.takeIf { it >= 0 } ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("Valid age required")
    
    // Process user...
}
```

### Custom Exception Classes

Creating custom exceptions allows for more specific error handling and better error reporting. Custom exceptions typically extend existing exception classes and can include additional context information.

```kotlin
// Simple custom exception
class NetworkException(message: String) : Exception(message)

// Exception with additional context
class ValidationException(
    message: String,
    val field: String,
    val value: Any?,
    cause: Throwable? = null
) : Exception(message, cause) {
    override fun toString(): String {
        return "ValidationException(field='$field', value=$value, message='$message')"
    }
}

// Exception with factory methods
class DatabaseException private constructor(
    message: String,
    val errorCode: Int,
    cause: Throwable? = null
) : Exception(message, cause) {
    
    companion object {
        fun connectionFailed(cause: Throwable) = 
            DatabaseException("Database connection failed", 1001, cause)
            
        fun queryTimeout(query: String) = 
            DatabaseException("Query timeout: $query", 1002)
            
        fun constraintViolation(constraint: String) = 
            DatabaseException("Constraint violation: $constraint", 1003)
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling Patterns

#### Elvis Operator with Exceptions

```kotlin
fun getUser(id: String): User {
    return userRepository.findById(id) 
        ?: throw UserNotFoundException("User not found: $id")
}
```

#### When Expression for Exception Handling

```kotlin
fun handleException(e: Exception): String {
    return when (e) {
        is NetworkException -> "Network error: ${e.message}"
        is ValidationException -> "Validation failed for ${e.field}: ${e.message}"
        is DatabaseException -> "Database error (${e.errorCode}): ${e.message}"
        else -> "Unknown error: ${e.message}"
    }
}
```

#### Result Pattern

```kotlin
sealed class Result<T> {
    data class Success<T>(val value: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error<T>(val exception: Exception) : Result<T>()
}

fun safeOperation(): Result<String> {
    return try {
        val result = riskyOperation()
        Result.Success(result)
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Result.Error(e)
    }
}
```

### Resource Management and Use Function

The `use` function provides automatic resource management, similar to Java's try-with-resources. It ensures resources are properly closed even if exceptions occur.

```kotlin
// Basic use function
file.inputStream().use { input ->
    // Process input stream
    input.read()
} // Stream is automatically closed

// Multiple resources
fun copyFile(source: File, destination: File) {
    source.inputStream().use { input ->
        destination.outputStream().use { output ->
            input.copyTo(output)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Custom Use Function Implementation

```kotlin
inline fun <T : AutoCloseable?, R> T.use(block: (T) -> R): R {
    var exception: Throwable? = null
    try {
        return block(this)
    } catch (e: Throwable) {
        exception = e
        throw e
    } finally {
        when {
            this == null -> {}
            exception == null -> close()
            else -> {
                try {
                    close()
                } catch (closeException: Throwable) {
                    exception.addSuppressed(closeException)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Database Connection Example

```kotlin
class DatabaseConnection : AutoCloseable {
    fun query(sql: String): ResultSet = TODO()
    override fun close() = TODO()
}

fun getUserData(userId: String): User {
    return DatabaseConnection().use { connection ->
        val resultSet = connection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
        User.fromResultSet(resultSet)
    } // Connection automatically closed
}
```

### Advanced Exception Handling

#### Suppressed Exceptions

```kotlin
fun demonstrateSuppressedExceptions() {
    try {
        AutoCloseable {
            throw RuntimeException("Resource cleanup failed")
        }.use {
            throw IllegalStateException("Main operation failed")
        }
    } catch (e: IllegalStateException) {
        println("Main exception: ${e.message}")
        e.suppressed.forEach { suppressed ->
            println("Suppressed: ${suppressed.message}")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Exception Chaining

```kotlin
fun processData(data: String) {
    try {
        parseData(data)
    } catch (e: ParseException) {
        throw ProcessingException("Failed to process data", e)
    }
}
```

#### Rethrowing with Context

```kotlin
fun serviceMethod() {
    try {
        lowLevelOperation()
    } catch (e: SQLException) {
        throw ServiceException("Service operation failed", e)
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

#### Exception Handling Strategy

```kotlin
// Don't catch exceptions you can't handle
fun badExample() {
    try {
        riskyOperation()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // Bad: Swallowing all exceptions
        println("Something went wrong")
    }
}

// Good: Handle specific exceptions appropriately
fun goodExample() {
    try {
        riskyOperation()
    } catch (e: ValidationException) {
        // Handle validation errors
        showValidationError(e)
    } catch (e: NetworkException) {
        // Handle network errors
        showNetworkError(e)
    }
    // Let other exceptions propagate
}
```

#### Fail-Fast Principle

```kotlin
class User(name: String, age: Int) {
    init {
        require(name.isNotBlank()) { "Name cannot be blank" }
        require(age >= 0) { "Age cannot be negative" }
    }
}
```

#### Precondition Checks

```kotlin
fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    check(b != 0) { "Division by zero" }
    return a / b
}

fun processItems(items: List<String>) {
    checkNotNull(items) { "Items list cannot be null" }
    require(items.isNotEmpty()) { "Items list cannot be empty" }
    // Process items
}
```

**Example** of comprehensive exception handling:

```kotlin
class UserService {
    fun createUser(userData: UserData): User {
        return try {
            // Validate input
            validateUserData(userData)
            
            // Create user
            val user = User(userData.name, userData.email, userData.age)
            
            // Save to database
            userRepository.save(user)
            
            user
        } catch (e: ValidationException) {
            logger.warn("User validation failed: ${e.message}")
            throw UserCreationException("Invalid user data", e)
        } catch (e: DatabaseException) {
            logger.error("Database operation failed", e)
            throw UserCreationException("Failed to save user", e)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            logger.error("Unexpected error during user creation", e)
            throw UserCreationException("User creation failed", e)
        }
    }
    
    private fun validateUserData(userData: UserData) {
        if (userData.name.isBlank()) {
            throw ValidationException("Name is required", "name", userData.name)
        }
        if (!userData.email.matches(EMAIL_REGEX)) {
            throw ValidationException("Invalid email format", "email", userData.email)
        }
        if (userData.age < 0) {
            throw ValidationException("Age cannot be negative", "age", userData.age)
        }
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**

Exception handling in Kotlin provides a powerful and flexible system for managing errors. The expression-based approach, combined with features like the `use` function and custom exception classes, enables developers to write robust, maintainable code. The key is to handle exceptions at the appropriate level, provide meaningful error messages, and ensure resources are properly managed.

## Testing Fundamentals

### Unit Testing with JUnit

JUnit is the most widely used testing framework for Kotlin/JVM applications. Kotlin's interoperability with Java makes it seamless to use JUnit for writing comprehensive unit tests.

#### Basic JUnit Setup

To use JUnit in your Kotlin project, add the dependency to your build file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.2")
    testImplementation("org.assertj:assertj-core:3.24.2")
}
```

#### Writing Basic Tests

```kotlin
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach
import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName

class CalculatorTest {
    private lateinit var calculator: Calculator
    
    @BeforeEach
    fun setup() {
        calculator = Calculator()
    }
    
    @AfterEach
    fun teardown() {
        // Clean up resources if needed
    }
    
    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should add two positive numbers correctly")
    fun `should add two positive numbers`() {
        val result = calculator.add(5, 3)
        assertEquals(8, result)
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle division by zero`() {
        assertThrows<ArithmeticException> {
            calculator.divide(10, 0)
        }
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should multiply numbers correctly`() {
        val testCases = listOf(
            Triple(2, 3, 6),
            Triple(-2, 3, -6),
            Triple(0, 5, 0)
        )
        
        testCases.forEach { (a, b, expected) ->
            assertEquals(expected, calculator.multiply(a, b))
        }
    }
}
```

#### Parameterized Tests

JUnit 5 supports parameterized tests, which are particularly useful for testing multiple scenarios:

```kotlin
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ValueSource
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvSource
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.MethodSource

class ValidationTest {
    
    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(strings = ["user@example.com", "test@domain.org", "admin@company.co.uk"])
    fun `should validate correct email formats`(email: String) {
        assertTrue(EmailValidator.isValid(email))
    }
    
    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource(
        "1, 1, 2",
        "2, 3, 5",
        "-1, 1, 0",
        "0, 0, 0"
    )
    fun `should add numbers correctly`(a: Int, b: Int, expected: Int) {
        assertEquals(expected, calculator.add(a, b))
    }
    
    @ParameterizedTest
    @MethodSource("passwordProvider")
    fun `should validate password strength`(password: String, expectedStrength: PasswordStrength) {
        assertEquals(expectedStrength, PasswordValidator.checkStrength(password))
    }
    
    companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        fun passwordProvider() = listOf(
            Arguments.of("123", PasswordStrength.WEAK),
            Arguments.of("password123", PasswordStrength.MEDIUM),
            Arguments.of("P@ssw0rd123!", PasswordStrength.STRONG)
        )
    }
}
```

### Kotlin-Specific Testing Features

#### Testing Data Classes

Kotlin's data classes provide automatic `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations that make testing more straightforward:

```kotlin
data class User(val id: Long, val name: String, val email: String)

class UserTest {
    @Test
    fun `should create user with correct properties`() {
        val user = User(1L, "John Doe", "john@example.com")
        
        assertEquals(1L, user.id)
        assertEquals("John Doe", user.name)
        assertEquals("john@example.com", user.email)
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should compare users by value`() {
        val user1 = User(1L, "John", "john@example.com")
        val user2 = User(1L, "John", "john@example.com")
        
        assertEquals(user1, user2)
        assertEquals(user1.hashCode(), user2.hashCode())
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should create copy with modified properties`() {
        val originalUser = User(1L, "John", "john@example.com")
        val updatedUser = originalUser.copy(name = "Jane")
        
        assertEquals("Jane", updatedUser.name)
        assertEquals(originalUser.id, updatedUser.id)
        assertEquals(originalUser.email, updatedUser.email)
    }
}
```

#### Testing Extension Functions

Extension functions can be tested like regular functions:

```kotlin
fun String.isValidEmail(): Boolean {
    return contains("@") && contains(".")
}

class ExtensionFunctionTest {
    @Test
    fun `should validate email format using extension function`() {
        assertTrue("user@example.com".isValidEmail())
        assertFalse("invalid-email".isValidEmail())
        assertFalse("user@".isValidEmail())
    }
}
```

#### Testing Sealed Classes

Sealed classes are excellent for representing finite sets of possibilities and can be tested comprehensively:

```kotlin
sealed class Result<T> {
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error<T>(val message: String) : Result<T>()
    data class Loading<T>(val progress: Int = 0) : Result<T>()
}

class ResultProcessor {
    fun <T> processResult(result: Result<T>): String {
        return when (result) {
            is Result.Success -> "Success: ${result.data}"
            is Result.Error -> "Error: ${result.message}"
            is Result.Loading -> "Loading: ${result.progress}%"
        }
    }
}

class ResultProcessorTest {
    private val processor = ResultProcessor()
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle success result`() {
        val result = Result.Success("Test data")
        assertEquals("Success: Test data", processor.processResult(result))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle error result`() {
        val result = Result.Error<String>("Network error")
        assertEquals("Error: Network error", processor.processResult(result))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle loading result`() {
        val result = Result.Loading<String>(50)
        assertEquals("Loading: 50%", processor.processResult(result))
    }
}
```

#### Testing Nullable Types

Kotlin's null safety features require specific testing approaches:

```kotlin
class UserService {
    fun findUserById(id: Long): User? {
        // Simulate database lookup
        return if (id > 0) User(id, "User $id", "user$id@example.com") else null
    }
    
    fun getUserDisplayName(user: User?): String {
        return user?.name ?: "Unknown User"
    }
}

class UserServiceTest {
    private val userService = UserService()
    
    @Test
    fun `should return user when id is valid`() {
        val user = userService.findUserById(1L)
        assertNotNull(user)
        assertEquals("User 1", user?.name)
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should return null when id is invalid`() {
        val user = userService.findUserById(-1L)
        assertNull(user)
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle null user gracefully`() {
        val displayName = userService.getUserDisplayName(null)
        assertEquals("Unknown User", displayName)
    }
}
```

### Mocking and Test Doubles

Test doubles are essential for isolating units under test from their dependencies. Kotlin works well with popular mocking frameworks.

#### MockK Framework

MockK is a Kotlin-native mocking framework that provides excellent support for Kotlin features:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    testImplementation("io.mockk:mockk:1.13.4")
}
```

```kotlin
import io.mockk.*

interface EmailService {
    fun sendEmail(to: String, subject: String, body: String): Boolean
}

class NotificationService(private val emailService: EmailService) {
    fun sendWelcomeEmail(user: User): Boolean {
        return emailService.sendEmail(
            to = user.email,
            subject = "Welcome!",
            body = "Welcome ${user.name}!"
        )
    }
}

class NotificationServiceTest {
    private val emailService = mockk<EmailService>()
    private val notificationService = NotificationService(emailService)
    
    @Test
    fun `should send welcome email successfully`() {
        val user = User(1L, "John", "john@example.com")
        
        every { emailService.sendEmail(any(), any(), any()) } returns true
        
        val result = notificationService.sendWelcomeEmail(user)
        
        assertTrue(result)
        verify { 
            emailService.sendEmail(
                to = "john@example.com",
                subject = "Welcome!",
                body = "Welcome John!"
            )
        }
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle email sending failure`() {
        val user = User(1L, "John", "john@example.com")
        
        every { emailService.sendEmail(any(), any(), any()) } returns false
        
        val result = notificationService.sendWelcomeEmail(user)
        
        assertFalse(result)
    }
}
```

#### Mocking Kotlin Objects and Singletons

MockK can mock Kotlin objects and singletons:

```kotlin
object ConfigurationManager {
    fun getProperty(key: String): String? {
        // Read from configuration file
        return System.getProperty(key)
    }
}

class DatabaseConnection {
    fun connect(): String {
        val host = ConfigurationManager.getProperty("db.host") ?: "localhost"
        val port = ConfigurationManager.getProperty("db.port") ?: "5432"
        return "Connected to $host:$port"
    }
}

class DatabaseConnectionTest {
    @Test
    fun `should connect with custom configuration`() {
        mockkObject(ConfigurationManager)
        
        every { ConfigurationManager.getProperty("db.host") } returns "prod-server"
        every { ConfigurationManager.getProperty("db.port") } returns "3306"
        
        val connection = DatabaseConnection()
        val result = connection.connect()
        
        assertEquals("Connected to prod-server:3306", result)
        
        unmockkObject(ConfigurationManager)
    }
}
```

#### Spying on Real Objects

Sometimes you need to spy on real objects to verify interactions while keeping the original behavior:

```kotlin
class FileLogger {
    fun log(message: String) {
        println("Logging: $message")
        // Write to file
    }
}

class AuditService {
    private val logger = FileLogger()
    
    fun auditUserAction(userId: Long, action: String) {
        logger.log("User $userId performed: $action")
    }
}

class AuditServiceTest {
    @Test
    fun `should log user actions`() {
        val auditService = spyk(AuditService())
        
        auditService.auditUserAction(123L, "login")
        
        verify { auditService.auditUserAction(123L, "login") }
    }
}
```

### Testing Coroutines (Introduction)

Kotlin coroutines require special consideration when testing due to their asynchronous nature.

#### Basic Coroutine Testing

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-test:1.7.3")
}
```

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.test.*
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class UserRepository {
    suspend fun fetchUser(id: Long): User {
        delay(1000) // Simulate network delay
        return User(id, "User $id", "user$id@example.com")
    }
}

class UserRepositoryTest {
    private val repository = UserRepository()
    
    @Test
    fun `should fetch user data`() = runTest {
        val user = repository.fetchUser(1L)
        
        assertEquals(1L, user.id)
        assertEquals("User 1", user.name)
    }
}
```

#### Testing with TestCoroutineScheduler

For more control over coroutine execution timing:

```kotlin
class DataSyncService {
    suspend fun syncData(): String {
        delay(5000) // Long operation
        return "Data synchronized"
    }
    
    suspend fun performPeriodicSync() {
        while (true) {
            syncData()
            delay(60000) // Wait 1 minute
        }
    }
}

class DataSyncServiceTest {
    private val service = DataSyncService()
    
    @Test
    fun `should complete sync operation`() = runTest {
        val result = service.syncData()
        assertEquals("Data synchronized", result)
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle periodic sync timing`() = runTest {
        val job = launch {
            service.performPeriodicSync()
        }
        
        // Advance time by 5 seconds to complete first sync
        testScheduler.advanceTimeBy(5000)
        
        // Advance time by 1 minute to trigger second sync
        testScheduler.advanceTimeBy(60000)
        
        job.cancel()
    }
}
```

#### Testing Coroutine Exception Handling

```kotlin
class NetworkService {
    suspend fun fetchData(url: String): String {
        if (url.isEmpty()) {
            throw IllegalArgumentException("URL cannot be empty")
        }
        
        delay(1000)
        return "Data from $url"
    }
}

class NetworkServiceTest {
    private val service = NetworkService()
    
    @Test
    fun `should throw exception for empty URL`() = runTest {
        assertThrows<IllegalArgumentException> {
            service.fetchData("")
        }
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle successful data fetch`() = runTest {
        val result = service.fetchData("https://api.example.com")
        assertEquals("Data from https://api.example.com", result)
    }
}
```

### Test Organization and Best Practices

#### Test Structure

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:

```kotlin
class OrderServiceTest {
    @Test
    fun `should calculate total price with tax`() {
        // Arrange
        val order = Order(
            items = listOf(
                OrderItem("Product A", 10.0, 2),
                OrderItem("Product B", 5.0, 1)
            )
        )
        val taxRate = 0.1
        val orderService = OrderService()
        
        // Act
        val total = orderService.calculateTotal(order, taxRate)
        
        // Assert
        assertEquals(27.5, total, 0.01)
    }
}
```

#### Test Naming Conventions

Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate the scenario being tested:

```kotlin
class UserValidatorTest {
    @Test
    fun `should return true when email has valid format`() { }
    
    @Test
    fun `should return false when email is missing at symbol`() { }
    
    @Test
    fun `should throw exception when email is null`() { }
}
```

#### Testing Edge Cases

Always test boundary conditions and edge cases:

```kotlin
class StringUtilsTest {
    @Test
    fun `should handle empty string`() {
        assertEquals("", StringUtils.capitalize(""))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle null string`() {
        assertNull(StringUtils.capitalize(null))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle single character string`() {
        assertEquals("A", StringUtils.capitalize("a"))
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Use JUnit 5 for modern testing features
- Leverage Kotlin's language features in tests (data classes, extension functions, etc.)
- Choose appropriate mocking frameworks (MockK for Kotlin-specific features)
- Use `runTest` for coroutine testing
- Follow consistent naming conventions and test structure
- Test both happy paths and edge cases

**Conclusion:** Effective testing in Kotlin combines JUnit's robust testing framework with Kotlin's expressive language features. By understanding how to test Kotlin-specific constructs like data classes, sealed classes, and coroutines, you can create comprehensive test suites that ensure code reliability and maintainability. The combination of proper mocking techniques and coroutine testing tools provides the foundation for testing even complex asynchronous applications.

# Concurrency and Coroutines

## Coroutines Basics

### Understanding Suspending Functions

Suspending functions are the foundation of Kotlin coroutines, allowing functions to pause execution without blocking the underlying thread. They can only be called from within a coroutine or another suspending function, marked with the `suspend` keyword.

```kotlin
suspend fun fetchUserData(userId: String): User {
    delay(1000) // Simulates network delay without blocking thread
    return userRepository.findById(userId)
}

suspend fun processData(): String {
    val data = fetchRemoteData() // Another suspending function
    return processResult(data)
}
```

When a suspending function encounters a suspension point (like `delay`), it pauses execution and releases the thread for other work. The coroutine runtime handles resuming execution when the suspension completes.

#### Suspension Points and Continuations

```kotlin
suspend fun demonstrateSuspension() {
    println("Before delay") // Executes immediately
    delay(1000) // Suspension point - thread is released
    println("After delay") // Resumes after delay
}

// Compiler transforms suspending functions using continuations
// Simplified representation:
fun demonstrateSuspension(continuation: Continuation<Unit>): Any? {
    // State machine implementation
    when (continuation.label) {
        0 -> {
            println("Before delay")
            return delay(1000, continuation)
        }
        1 -> {
            println("After delay")
            return Unit
        }
    }
}
```

#### Calling Suspending Functions

```kotlin
class UserService {
    // Suspending function can call other suspending functions
    suspend fun getUser(id: String): User {
        return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            userRepository.findById(id)
        }
    }
    
    // Regular function cannot call suspending functions directly
    fun getUserSync(id: String): User {
        // This would cause compilation error:
        // return getUser(id)
        
        // Must use coroutine builder:
        return runBlocking {
            getUser(id)
        }
    }
}
```

### Coroutine Builders

Coroutine builders are functions that create and start coroutines. Each builder serves different purposes and has distinct characteristics.

#### Launch Builder

The `launch` builder creates a coroutine that runs concurrently with other code. It returns a `Job` object that can be used to control the coroutine's lifecycle.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() {
    val job = GlobalScope.launch {
        repeat(5) { i ->
            println("Coroutine iteration $i")
            delay(500)
        }
    }
    
    // Main thread continues executing
    println("Main thread continues")
    
    // Wait for coroutine to complete
    runBlocking {
        job.join()
    }
}
```

#### Launch with Exception Handling

```kotlin
fun demonstrateLaunchExceptions() = runBlocking {
    val job = launch {
        try {
            delay(1000)
            throw RuntimeException("Something went wrong")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Caught in coroutine: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
    
    job.join()
    println("Main coroutine completed")
}
```

#### Async Builder

The `async` builder creates a coroutine that computes a value concurrently. It returns a `Deferred` object that can be awaited to get the result.

```kotlin
suspend fun fetchUserAsync(userId: String): Deferred<User> {
    return GlobalScope.async {
        delay(1000) // Simulate network call
        User(userId, "John Doe")
    }
}

fun demonstrateAsync() = runBlocking {
    val userDeferred = async { fetchUser("123") }
    val profileDeferred = async { fetchProfile("123") }
    
    // Both operations run concurrently
    val user = userDeferred.await()
    val profile = profileDeferred.await()
    
    println("User: $user, Profile: $profile")
}
```

#### Async vs Launch Comparison

```kotlin
fun compareAsyncAndLaunch() = runBlocking {
    // Using async for concurrent operations with results
    val time1 = measureTimeMillis {
        val deferred1 = async { computeValue(1) }
        val deferred2 = async { computeValue(2) }
        val result = deferred1.await() + deferred2.await()
        println("Async result: $result")
    }
    
    // Using launch for fire-and-forget operations
    val time2 = measureTimeMillis {
        val job1 = launch { performTask(1) }
        val job2 = launch { performTask(2) }
        joinAll(job1, job2)
    }
    
    println("Async time: $time1ms, Launch time: $time2ms")
}

suspend fun computeValue(n: Int): Int {
    delay(1000)
    return n * n
}
```

#### RunBlocking Builder

The `runBlocking` builder creates a coroutine that blocks the current thread until completion. It's primarily used for bridging between blocking and non-blocking code.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Blocks main thread until coroutine completes
    runBlocking {
        delay(1000)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,") // This executes after the coroutine
}

// Common use case: Testing
class UserServiceTest {
    @Test
    fun testUserCreation() = runBlocking {
        val user = userService.createUser("testUser")
        assertEquals("testUser", user.name)
    }
}
```

### Coroutine Scope and Context

Coroutine scope defines the lifecycle and cancellation behavior of coroutines, while context provides configuration information like dispatcher and exception handling.

#### Coroutine Scope

```kotlin
class UserViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // ViewModelScope automatically cancels when ViewModel is cleared
    private val viewModelScope = CoroutineScope(
        SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main.immediate
    )
    
    fun loadUser(userId: String) {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            try {
                val user = userRepository.getUser(userId)
                updateUI(user)
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                showError(e)
            }
        }
    }
    
    override fun onCleared() {
        super.onCleared()
        viewModelScope.cancel()
    }
}
```

#### Custom Scope Creation

```kotlin
class BackgroundTaskManager {
    private val scope = CoroutineScope(
        SupervisorJob() + 
        Dispatchers.IO + 
        CoroutineName("BackgroundTasks")
    )
    
    fun scheduleTask(task: suspend () -> Unit) {
        scope.launch {
            try {
                task()
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                handleTaskError(e)
            }
        }
    }
    
    fun shutdown() {
        scope.cancel()
    }
}
```

#### Coroutine Context

The coroutine context is a set of elements that define the coroutine's behavior, including dispatcher, job, exception handler, and debug information.

```kotlin
fun demonstrateContext() = runBlocking {
    val context = Job() + Dispatchers.IO + CoroutineName("MyCoroutine")
    
    launch(context) {
        println("Coroutine name: ${coroutineContext[CoroutineName]}")
        println("Dispatcher: ${coroutineContext[ContinuationInterceptor]}")
        println("Job: ${coroutineContext[Job]}")
    }
}
```

#### Context Inheritance and Modification

```kotlin
fun demonstrateContextInheritance() = runBlocking {
    println("Main context: ${coroutineContext[CoroutineName]}")
    
    launch(CoroutineName("Child")) {
        println("Child context: ${coroutineContext[CoroutineName]}")
        
        // Inherits parent context but overrides specific elements
        launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
            println("Grandchild context: ${coroutineContext[CoroutineName]}")
            println("Grandchild dispatcher: ${coroutineContext[ContinuationInterceptor]}")
        }
    }
}
```

### Structured Concurrency Principles

Structured concurrency ensures that coroutines are properly managed, preventing resource leaks and ensuring predictable cancellation behavior.

#### Parent-Child Relationships

```kotlin
fun demonstrateStructuredConcurrency() = runBlocking {
    val parentJob = launch {
        println("Parent started")
        
        val child1 = launch {
            delay(1000)
            println("Child 1 completed")
        }
        
        val child2 = launch {
            delay(2000)
            println("Child 2 completed")
        }
        
        // Parent waits for all children
        println("Parent waiting for children")
    }
    
    // If parent is cancelled, all children are cancelled
    delay(1500)
    parentJob.cancel()
    println("Parent cancelled")
}
```

#### Cancellation Propagation

```kotlin
fun demonstrateCancellationPropagation() = runBlocking {
    val parentJob = launch {
        try {
            launch {
                delay(1000)
                println("Child 1 completed")
            }
            
            launch {
                delay(2000)
                println("Child 2 completed")
            }
            
            delay(3000)
            println("Parent completed")
        } finally {
            println("Parent cleanup")
        }
    }
    
    delay(1500)
    parentJob.cancel("Manual cancellation")
    parentJob.join()
}
```

#### Exception Handling in Structured Concurrency

```kotlin
fun demonstrateExceptionHandling() = runBlocking {
    val handler = CoroutineExceptionHandler { _, exception ->
        println("Caught exception: ${exception.message}")
    }
    
    val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + handler)
    
    scope.launch {
        launch {
            delay(1000)
            throw RuntimeException("Child 1 failed")
        }
        
        launch {
            delay(2000)
            println("Child 2 completed successfully")
        }
    }
    
    delay(3000)
    scope.cancel()
}
```

#### Supervisor Job vs Regular Job

```kotlin
fun compareSupervisorJob() = runBlocking {
    println("=== Regular Job ===")
    val regularJob = launch {
        launch {
            delay(1000)
            throw RuntimeException("Child failed")
        }
        
        launch {
            delay(2000)
            println("This won't execute - parent cancelled")
        }
    }
    
    regularJob.join()
    
    println("\n=== Supervisor Job ===")
    val supervisorScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob())
    
    supervisorScope.launch {
        launch {
            delay(1000)
            throw RuntimeException("Child failed")
        }
        
        launch {
            delay(2000)
            println("This will execute - supervisor isolates failures")
        }
    }
    
    delay(3000)
    supervisorScope.cancel()
}
```

### Practical Examples

#### Concurrent API Calls

```kotlin
class DataService {
    suspend fun fetchUserProfile(userId: String): UserProfile {
        return coroutineScope {
            val userDeferred = async { userApi.getUser(userId) }
            val preferencesDeferred = async { preferencesApi.getPreferences(userId) }
            val activityDeferred = async { activityApi.getRecentActivity(userId) }
            
            UserProfile(
                user = userDeferred.await(),
                preferences = preferencesDeferred.await(),
                recentActivity = activityDeferred.await()
            )
        }
    }
}
```

#### Timeout Handling

```kotlin
suspend fun fetchWithTimeout(url: String): String {
    return withTimeout(5000) {
        httpClient.get(url)
    }
}

suspend fun fetchWithTimeoutOrNull(url: String): String? {
    return withTimeoutOrNull(5000) {
        httpClient.get(url)
    }
}
```

#### Resource Management

```kotlin
class DatabaseService {
    private val scope = CoroutineScope(
        SupervisorJob() + 
        Dispatchers.IO + 
        CoroutineName("DatabaseService")
    )
    
    fun startPeriodicCleanup() {
        scope.launch {
            while (isActive) {
                try {
                    performCleanup()
                    delay(TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(1))
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    logger.error("Cleanup failed", e)
                    delay(TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(5)) // Retry after delay
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    fun close() {
        scope.cancel()
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Suspending functions can pause execution without blocking threads
- Launch is for fire-and-forget operations, async is for concurrent computations
- RunBlocking bridges blocking and non-blocking code
- Coroutine scope manages lifecycle and cancellation
- Structured concurrency prevents resource leaks and ensures predictable behavior

**Example** of comprehensive coroutine usage:

```kotlin
class ImageProcessor {
    private val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)
    
    suspend fun processImages(imageUrls: List<String>): List<ProcessedImage> {
        return coroutineScope {
            imageUrls.map { url ->
                async {
                    try {
                        val image = downloadImage(url)
                        processImage(image)
                    } catch (e: Exception) {
                        logger.error("Failed to process image: $url", e)
                        null
                    }
                }
            }.awaitAll().filterNotNull()
        }
    }
    
    private suspend fun downloadImage(url: String): ByteArray {
        return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            httpClient.get(url)
        }
    }
    
    private suspend fun processImage(imageData: ByteArray): ProcessedImage {
        return withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {
            // CPU-intensive image processing
            ImageUtils.process(imageData)
        }
    }
    
    fun shutdown() {
        scope.cancel()
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**

Coroutines basics provide the foundation for asynchronous programming in Kotlin. Understanding suspending functions, coroutine builders, scope management, and structured concurrency principles is essential for writing efficient, maintainable concurrent code. The key is to use the appropriate builder for each use case and ensure proper scope management to prevent resource leaks.

## Advanced Coroutines

### Channels for Communication

Channels in Kotlin provide a way for coroutines to communicate with each other by sending and receiving values. They act as a bridge between coroutines, enabling safe data transfer without shared mutable state.

#### Channel Types and Capacity

Channels come in different types based on their capacity and behavior. The `Channel()` function creates a rendezvous channel by default, which has zero capacity and requires both sender and receiver to be ready simultaneously. You can specify capacity using `Channel(capacity)` where capacity can be a specific number, `Channel.UNLIMITED` for unlimited buffering, or `Channel.CONFLATED` where new values replace old ones.

```kotlin
val channel = Channel<Int>()
val bufferedChannel = Channel<Int>(10)
val unlimitedChannel = Channel<Int>(Channel.UNLIMITED)
val conflatedChannel = Channel<Int>(Channel.CONFLATED)
```

#### Sending and Receiving

The `send()` function is a suspending function that sends values to the channel, while `receive()` suspends until a value is available. For non-blocking operations, use `trySend()` and `tryReceive()` which return immediately with a result indicating success or failure.

```kotlin
launch {
    channel.send(42)
    channel.close()
}

launch {
    for (value in channel) {
        println(value)
    }
}
```

#### Channel Closing and Completion

Channels should be closed when no more elements will be sent using `close()`. This allows receivers to know when to stop waiting for new values. The `isClosedForSend` and `isClosedForReceive` properties help determine channel state.

#### Producer and Actor Patterns

The producer builder creates a channel and launches a coroutine that sends values to it, returning a `ReceiveChannel`. The actor pattern processes incoming messages sequentially, providing a safe way to handle mutable state.

```kotlin
fun produceNumbers() = produce<Int> {
    var x = 1
    while (true) send(x++)
}

fun counterActor() = actor<CounterMsg> {
    var counter = 0
    for (msg in channel) {
        when (msg) {
            is IncCounter -> counter++
            is GetCounter -> msg.response.complete(counter)
        }
    }
}
```

### Flow for Reactive Programming

Flow is Kotlin's reactive stream implementation that represents a cold asynchronous data stream. Unlike channels, flows are cold streams that don't produce values until collected.

#### Flow Builders

The `flow` builder is the most fundamental way to create flows. It takes a suspending lambda that can emit values using the `emit()` function. Other builders include `flowOf()` for static values and `asFlow()` for converting collections.

```kotlin
val flow = flow {
    for (i in 1..5) {
        delay(100)
        emit(i)
    }
}

val staticFlow = flowOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val collectionFlow = listOf(1, 2, 3).asFlow()
```

#### Flow Operators

Flow provides numerous operators for transforming, filtering, and combining streams. The `map` operator transforms each emitted value, `filter` removes values based on a predicate, and `take` limits the number of emitted values.

```kotlin
flow.map { it * 2 }
    .filter { it > 5 }
    .take(3)
    .collect { println(it) }
```

Combining operators like `zip`, `combine`, and `merge` allow working with multiple flows. `zip` pairs values from two flows, `combine` emits whenever any flow emits, and `merge` flattens multiple flows into one.

#### Flow Context and Threading

Flows preserve context by default, meaning they execute in the same coroutine context where they're collected. The `flowOn` operator changes the context for upstream operations, while `launchIn` collects the flow in a specific scope.

```kotlin
flow {
    emit(Thread.currentThread().name)
}
.flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)
.collect { println(it) }
```

#### State Management with StateFlow and SharedFlow

`StateFlow` represents a state-holding observable flow that emits current and new state updates. It's hot, meaning it's always active and retains the latest value. `SharedFlow` is a hot flow that can replay a specified number of values to new subscribers.

```kotlin
class ViewModel {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow(initialState)
    val state: StateFlow<State> = _state.asStateFlow()
    
    private val _events = MutableSharedFlow<Event>()
    val events: SharedFlow<Event> = _events.asSharedFlow()
}
```

#### Flow Exception Handling

Flow exceptions can be handled using the `catch` operator, which catches upstream exceptions and can emit replacement values. The `onEach` operator allows side effects without transforming values, useful for logging or debugging.

```kotlin
flow {
    emit(1)
    throw RuntimeException("Error")
}
.catch { e -> emit(-1) }
.collect { println(it) }
```

### Exception Handling in Coroutines

Exception handling in coroutines follows structured concurrency principles, where exceptions propagate through the coroutine hierarchy and can cancel parent and sibling coroutines.

#### Exception Propagation

Unhandled exceptions in coroutines propagate to their parent, potentially canceling the entire coroutine scope. This behavior ensures that failures don't go unnoticed and provides a clean failure model.

```kotlin
val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob())
scope.launch {
    launch {
        throw RuntimeException("Child failed")
    }
    delay(1000)
    println("This won't execute")
}
```

#### SupervisorJob and supervisorScope

`SupervisorJob` prevents child failures from canceling siblings, making it useful for scenarios where independent operations should continue even if others fail. The `supervisorScope` function creates a scope with supervisor behavior.

```kotlin
supervisorScope {
    launch {
        throw RuntimeException("This fails")
    }
    launch {
        delay(1000)
        println("This still executes")
    }
}
```

#### CoroutineExceptionHandler

`CoroutineExceptionHandler` provides a last-resort mechanism for handling uncaught exceptions. It only handles exceptions that would otherwise terminate the application and should be used sparingly.

```kotlin
val handler = CoroutineExceptionHandler { _, exception ->
    println("Caught $exception")
}

val scope = CoroutineScope(Job() + handler)
scope.launch {
    throw RuntimeException("Handled by exception handler")
}
```

#### Try-Catch in Coroutines

Regular try-catch blocks work within coroutine builders, but they only catch exceptions from the immediate suspending function, not from child coroutines. Use `runCatching` for functional exception handling.

```kotlin
try {
    val result = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Suspending operation
        riskyOperation()
    }
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle exception
}

val result = runCatching {
    riskyOperation()
}.getOrElse { defaultValue }
```

### Coroutine Cancellation and Timeouts

Coroutine cancellation is cooperative, meaning coroutines must check for cancellation and respond appropriately. This mechanism ensures resource cleanup and prevents runaway coroutines.

#### Cancellation Basics

Coroutines can be cancelled using the `cancel()` method on their job. Cancellation is immediate for suspending functions that check for cancellation, but compute-intensive code needs explicit cancellation checks.

```kotlin
val job = launch {
    repeat(1000) { i ->
        if (!isActive) return@launch
        // or ensureActive()
        println("Working $i")
        delay(100)
    }
}

delay(500)
job.cancel()
```

#### Cancellation Exceptions

When a coroutine is cancelled, it receives a `CancellationException`. This exception should generally not be caught or suppressed, as it's part of the normal cancellation mechanism.

```kotlin
launch {
    try {
        delay(1000)
    } catch (e: CancellationException) {
        println("Cancelled")
        throw e // Re-throw to complete cancellation
    }
}
```

#### Resource Cleanup

Use `try-finally` blocks or `use` function for resource cleanup in cancellable coroutines. The `finally` block executes even when the coroutine is cancelled, ensuring proper resource management.

```kotlin
launch {
    try {
        // Work with resources
        val resource = acquireResource()
        doWork(resource)
    } finally {
        // Cleanup always executes
        releaseResource()
    }
}
```

#### Timeouts

The `withTimeout` function automatically cancels the coroutine if it doesn't complete within the specified time. `withTimeoutOrNull` returns null instead of throwing an exception on timeout.

```kotlin
try {
    withTimeout(5000) {
        longRunningOperation()
    }
} catch (e: TimeoutCancellationException) {
    println("Operation timed out")
}

val result = withTimeoutOrNull(5000) {
    longRunningOperation()
} ?: "Default value"
```

#### Non-Cancellable Operations

Sometimes operations need to complete even during cancellation, such as cleanup code. Use `NonCancellable` context for such operations, but use it sparingly as it can prevent proper cancellation.

```kotlin
launch {
    try {
        cancellableWork()
    } finally {
        withContext(NonCancellable) {
            criticalCleanup()
        }
    }
}
```

**Key points**: Channels enable safe communication between coroutines with various capacity options and patterns. Flow provides reactive programming capabilities with extensive operators and context management. Exception handling follows structured concurrency with propagation and supervisor patterns. Cancellation is cooperative and requires explicit checks in compute-intensive code, with proper resource cleanup mechanisms.

# DSLs and Metaprogramming

## Domain-Specific Languages in Kotlin

### DSL Design Principles

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are mini-languages designed to solve problems in a specific domain with syntax that closely resembles natural language or domain terminology. In Kotlin, DSLs leverage the language's expressive syntax to create readable, maintainable code that domain experts can understand.

The fundamental principles of DSL design include expressiveness, where the syntax should clearly communicate intent; safety, ensuring compile-time verification of correctness; and fluency, creating a natural flow that reads like prose. Kotlin's features like extension functions, operator overloading, and lambda expressions make it particularly well-suited for DSL creation.

Context is crucial in DSL design. A well-designed DSL should establish clear boundaries between different contexts, preventing operations that don't make sense in a particular scope. This is achieved through careful type design and scope management, ensuring that only valid operations are available at any given point in the DSL.

### Type-Safe Builders

Type-safe builders represent one of Kotlin's most powerful DSL patterns. They provide compile-time safety while maintaining readability and expressiveness. The pattern relies on creating builder classes that encapsulate the construction logic and expose only relevant operations through carefully designed APIs.

The builder pattern in Kotlin typically involves creating a builder class with methods that return the builder instance, allowing for method chaining. However, Kotlin's lambda with receiver feature enables a more sophisticated approach where the builder becomes the receiver of lambda expressions, creating a more natural syntax.

```kotlin
class HtmlBuilder {
    private val elements = mutableListOf<String>()
    
    fun head(init: HeadBuilder.() -> Unit) {
        val headBuilder = HeadBuilder()
        headBuilder.init()
        elements.add(headBuilder.build())
    }
    
    fun body(init: BodyBuilder.() -> Unit) {
        val bodyBuilder = BodyBuilder()
        bodyBuilder.init()
        elements.add(bodyBuilder.build())
    }
    
    fun build(): String = "<html>${elements.joinToString("")}</html>"
}

class HeadBuilder {
    private var title: String = ""
    
    fun title(value: String) {
        title = value
    }
    
    fun build(): String = "<head><title>$title</title></head>"
}
```

Type safety is achieved by designing builders that only expose methods appropriate for their current context. This prevents common errors like placing body elements inside a head section or using incompatible attributes on HTML elements.

### Lambda with Receiver

Lambda with receiver is the cornerstone of Kotlin's DSL capabilities. This feature allows lambda expressions to be executed in the context of a receiver object, making the receiver's members directly accessible within the lambda without qualification.

The syntax `T.() -> Unit` defines a lambda with receiver, where `T` is the receiver type. Inside such lambdas, `this` refers to the receiver object, and its members can be accessed directly. This creates a natural scoping mechanism that's essential for DSL construction.

```kotlin
fun buildString(builderAction: StringBuilder.() -> Unit): String {
    val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
    stringBuilder.builderAction()
    return stringBuilder.toString()
}

// Usage
val result = buildString {
    append("Hello ")
    append("World")
    appendLine("!")
}
```

The power of lambda with receiver becomes apparent when creating nested DSLs. Each level of nesting can have its own receiver type, providing different sets of available operations. This enables the creation of highly structured DSLs that guide users through complex configuration or construction processes.

Advanced usage involves combining multiple receiver types through extension functions and careful API design. This allows for sophisticated DSLs that can adapt their behavior based on context while maintaining type safety.

### Creating Internal DSLs

Internal DSLs are implemented within the host language (Kotlin) and leverage its syntax and type system. They offer the advantage of full integration with existing tooling, debugging support, and the ability to seamlessly mix DSL code with regular Kotlin code.

The process of creating an internal DSL begins with identifying the domain concepts and their relationships. This involves understanding the vocabulary, operations, and constraints of the target domain. The DSL should model these concepts as types and operations, creating a type-safe representation of the domain.

**Key points** for internal DSL creation include establishing clear entry points that initialize the DSL context, designing fluent interfaces that guide users through valid operation sequences, and implementing proper scoping to prevent invalid operations. The DSL should also provide meaningful error messages when constraints are violated.

```kotlin
// Configuration DSL example
class DatabaseConfig {
    var host: String = "localhost"
    var port: Int = 5432
    var username: String = ""
    var password: String = ""
    var ssl: Boolean = false
}

class ConnectionPoolConfig {
    var maxConnections: Int = 10
    var minConnections: Int = 1
    var connectionTimeout: Long = 30000
}

class DatabaseBuilder {
    private var config = DatabaseConfig()
    private var poolConfig = ConnectionPoolConfig()
    
    fun connection(init: DatabaseConfig.() -> Unit) {
        config.init()
    }
    
    fun pool(init: ConnectionPoolConfig.() -> Unit) {
        poolConfig.init()
    }
    
    fun build(): Database = Database(config, poolConfig)
}

fun database(init: DatabaseBuilder.() -> Unit): Database {
    val builder = DatabaseBuilder()
    builder.init()
    return builder.build()
}
```

**Example** usage demonstrates the natural flow of a well-designed DSL:

```kotlin
val db = database {
    connection {
        host = "production.db.com"
        port = 5432
        username = "app_user"
        password = "secure_password"
        ssl = true
    }
    
    pool {
        maxConnections = 20
        minConnections = 5
        connectionTimeout = 45000
    }
}
```

Validation and error handling are crucial aspects of DSL design. The DSL should validate configurations at appropriate points, preferably at compile time when possible, and provide clear error messages that relate to the domain concepts rather than implementation details.

Testing DSLs requires special consideration. Unit tests should verify that the DSL produces correct results for valid inputs and provides appropriate error messages for invalid inputs. Integration tests should verify that the DSL correctly integrates with the underlying systems it configures or controls.

Performance considerations include minimizing object creation during DSL evaluation and designing the DSL to support lazy evaluation where appropriate. The DSL should also be designed to support serialization and deserialization if the configuration needs to be persisted or transmitted.

**Conclusion**

Domain-Specific Languages in Kotlin provide a powerful mechanism for creating readable, maintainable code that closely models domain concepts. Through careful application of type-safe builders, lambda with receiver, and thoughtful API design, developers can create DSLs that are both expressive and safe. The key to successful DSL design lies in understanding the target domain, establishing clear boundaries and contexts, and leveraging Kotlin's language features to create natural, fluent interfaces.

## Reflection and Annotations

### Kotlin Reflection API

Kotlin's reflection API provides runtime introspection capabilities, allowing you to examine and manipulate classes, functions, and properties at runtime. The reflection API is built on top of Java reflection but provides Kotlin-specific features and syntax.

#### Basic Reflection Setup

To use Kotlin reflection, add the dependency to your project:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:1.9.10")
}
```

#### Getting Class References

Kotlin provides several ways to obtain class references:

```kotlin
import kotlin.reflect.*

class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
    fun greet() = "Hello, I'm $name"
}

fun main() {
    // Getting KClass from class literal
    val personClass: KClass<Person> = Person::class
    
    // Getting KClass from instance
    val person = Person("Alice", 30)
    val personClassFromInstance = person::class
    
    // Getting Java Class
    val javaClass = Person::class.java
    
    // Converting between KClass and Java Class
    val kotlinClass = javaClass.kotlin
    
    println("Class name: ${personClass.simpleName}")
    println("Qualified name: ${personClass.qualifiedName}")
    println("Is data class: ${personClass.isData}")
}
```

#### Inspecting Class Members

```kotlin
data class Employee(
    val id: Long,
    val name: String,
    val department: String,
    val salary: Double
) {
    fun getDisplayName(): String = "$name ($department)"
    
    fun increaseSalary(percentage: Double): Employee {
        return copy(salary = salary * (1 + percentage / 100))
    }
}

fun inspectClass() {
    val employeeClass = Employee::class
    
    // Get all properties
    println("Properties:")
    employeeClass.memberProperties.forEach { property ->
        println("  ${property.name}: ${property.returnType}")
    }
    
    // Get all functions
    println("\nFunctions:")
    employeeClass.memberFunctions.forEach { function ->
        println("  ${function.name}: ${function.returnType}")
        println("    Parameters: ${function.parameters.map { it.name to it.type }}")
    }
    
    // Get constructors
    println("\nConstructors:")
    employeeClass.constructors.forEach { constructor ->
        println("  Parameters: ${constructor.parameters.map { it.name to it.type }}")
    }
}
```

#### Property Reflection

Property reflection allows you to get and set property values dynamically:

```kotlin
class Configuration {
    var host: String = "localhost"
    var port: Int = 8080
    var enabled: Boolean = true
}

fun demonstratePropertyReflection() {
    val config = Configuration()
    val configClass = Configuration::class
    
    // Get property by name
    val hostProperty = configClass.memberProperties.find { it.name == "host" }
    if (hostProperty is KMutableProperty1<Configuration, String>) {
        println("Current host: ${hostProperty.get(config)}")
        hostProperty.set(config, "example.com")
        println("Updated host: ${hostProperty.get(config)}")
    }
    
    // Iterate through all properties
    configClass.memberProperties.forEach { property ->
        when (property) {
            is KMutableProperty1<Configuration, *> -> {
                val value = property.get(config)
                println("${property.name}: $value (mutable)")
            }
            is KProperty1<Configuration, *> -> {
                val value = property.get(config)
                println("${property.name}: $value (read-only)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Function Reflection

Function reflection enables dynamic function invocation:

```kotlin
class Calculator {
    fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
    fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a * b
    fun divide(a: Double, b: Double): Double = a / b
}

fun demonstrateFunctionReflection() {
    val calculator = Calculator()
    val calculatorClass = Calculator::class
    
    // Get function by name
    val addFunction = calculatorClass.memberFunctions.find { it.name == "add" }
    if (addFunction != null) {
        val result = addFunction.call(calculator, 5, 3)
        println("5 + 3 = $result")
    }
    
    // Dynamic function calling based on operation name
    val operations = mapOf(
        "add" to listOf(10, 5),
        "multiply" to listOf(4, 3),
        "divide" to listOf(15.0, 3.0)
    )
    
    operations.forEach { (operationName, args) ->
        val function = calculatorClass.memberFunctions.find { it.name == operationName }
        if (function != null) {
            val result = function.call(calculator, *args.toTypedArray())
            println("$operationName${args} = $result")
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating Custom Annotations

Annotations provide metadata about code elements and can be processed at compile-time or runtime.

#### Basic Annotation Declaration

```kotlin
// Simple marker annotation
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Entity

// Annotation with parameters
@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Column(
    val name: String,
    val nullable: Boolean = true,
    val unique: Boolean = false
)

// Annotation with multiple targets
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS, AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Deprecated(
    val message: String,
    val replaceWith: String = ""
)
```

#### Advanced Annotation Features

```kotlin
// Annotation with array parameters
@Target(AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class ValidateParams(
    val rules: Array<String>,
    val groups: Array<KClass<*>> = []
)

// Annotation with enum parameters
enum class AccessLevel { PUBLIC, PRIVATE, PROTECTED }

@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class AccessControl(
    val level: AccessLevel = AccessLevel.PUBLIC,
    val roles: Array<String> = []
)

// Nested annotations
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class ApiEndpoint(
    val path: String,
    val method: HttpMethod = HttpMethod.GET,
    val security: Security = Security()
)

annotation class Security(
    val requiresAuth: Boolean = true,
    val roles: Array<String> = []
)

enum class HttpMethod { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE }
```

#### Using Custom Annotations

```kotlin
@Entity
@ApiEndpoint("/users", HttpMethod.POST)
class User(
    @Column("user_id", nullable = false, unique = true)
    val id: Long,
    
    @Column("full_name")
    val name: String,
    
    @Column("email_address", unique = true)
    @AccessControl(AccessLevel.PRIVATE, ["admin", "user"])
    val email: String
) {
    @ValidateParams(["notEmpty", "validEmail"])
    fun updateEmail(newEmail: String) {
        // Update email logic
    }
}
```

### Annotation Processing

Annotation processing allows you to read and act upon annotations at runtime.

#### Runtime Annotation Processing

```kotlin
class AnnotationProcessor {
    fun processEntity(obj: Any) {
        val kClass = obj::class
        
        // Check if class has Entity annotation
        val entityAnnotation = kClass.findAnnotation<Entity>()
        if (entityAnnotation != null) {
            println("Processing entity: ${kClass.simpleName}")
            
            // Process API endpoint annotation
            val apiAnnotation = kClass.findAnnotation<ApiEndpoint>()
            if (apiAnnotation != null) {
                println("  API Path: ${apiAnnotation.path}")
                println("  HTTP Method: ${apiAnnotation.method}")
                println("  Requires Auth: ${apiAnnotation.security.requiresAuth}")
            }
            
            // Process property annotations
            processProperties(obj, kClass)
        }
    }
    
    private fun processProperties(obj: Any, kClass: KClass<*>) {
        kClass.memberProperties.forEach { property ->
            val columnAnnotation = property.findAnnotation<Column>()
            if (columnAnnotation != null) {
                val value = property.getter.call(obj)
                println("  Column ${columnAnnotation.name}: $value")
                println("    Nullable: ${columnAnnotation.nullable}")
                println("    Unique: ${columnAnnotation.unique}")
            }
            
            val accessAnnotation = property.findAnnotation<AccessControl>()
            if (accessAnnotation != null) {
                println("  Access Level: ${accessAnnotation.level}")
                println("  Roles: ${accessAnnotation.roles.joinToString()}")
            }
        }
    }
}

fun demonstrateAnnotationProcessing() {
    val user = User(1L, "John Doe", "john@example.com")
    val processor = AnnotationProcessor()
    processor.processEntity(user)
}
```

#### Building a Simple ORM with Annotations

```kotlin
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Table(val name: String)

@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Id

@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Column(val name: String = "")

class SimpleORM {
    fun generateCreateTableSQL(kClass: KClass<*>): String {
        val tableAnnotation = kClass.findAnnotation<Table>()
        val tableName = tableAnnotation?.name ?: kClass.simpleName?.lowercase()
        
        val columns = kClass.memberProperties.mapNotNull { property ->
            val columnAnnotation = property.findAnnotation<Column>()
            val idAnnotation = property.findAnnotation<Id>()
            
            if (columnAnnotation != null || idAnnotation != null) {
                val columnName = columnAnnotation?.name?.takeIf { it.isNotEmpty() } 
                    ?: property.name.lowercase()
                
                val sqlType = when (property.returnType.classifier) {
                    String::class -> "VARCHAR(255)"
                    Int::class -> "INTEGER"
                    Long::class -> "BIGINT"
                    Double::class -> "DOUBLE"
                    Boolean::class -> "BOOLEAN"
                    else -> "TEXT"
                }
                
                val constraints = mutableListOf<String>()
                if (idAnnotation != null) {
                    constraints.add("PRIMARY KEY")
                }
                
                "$columnName $sqlType ${constraints.joinToString(" ")}"
            } else null
        }
        
        return "CREATE TABLE $tableName (\n  ${columns.joinToString(",\n  ")}\n);"
    }
}

@Table("users")
class DatabaseUser(
    @Id
    val id: Long,
    
    @Column("full_name")
    val name: String,
    
    @Column("email_address")
    val email: String,
    
    val age: Int // No annotation, will be ignored
)

fun demonstrateORM() {
    val orm = SimpleORM()
    val sql = orm.generateCreateTableSQL(DatabaseUser::class)
    println(sql)
}
```

### KClass and KFunction Usage

#### Working with KClass

```kotlin
class TypeInspector {
    fun inspectType(kClass: KClass<*>) {
        println("=== Type Information ===")
        println("Simple name: ${kClass.simpleName}")
        println("Qualified name: ${kClass.qualifiedName}")
        println("Is abstract: ${kClass.isAbstract}")
        println("Is final: ${kClass.isFinal}")
        println("Is open: ${kClass.isOpen}")
        println("Is data class: ${kClass.isData}")
        println("Is sealed: ${kClass.isSealed}")
        
        // Supertypes
        println("\nSupertypes:")
        kClass.supertypes.forEach { supertype ->
            println("  $supertype")
        }
        
        // Type parameters
        if (kClass.typeParameters.isNotEmpty()) {
            println("\nType parameters:")
            kClass.typeParameters.forEach { param ->
                println("  ${param.name}: ${param.upperBounds}")
            }
        }
    }
}

// Generic class for demonstration
class Repository<T : Any>(private val entityClass: KClass<T>) {
    fun getEntityType(): KClass<T> = entityClass
    
    fun createInstance(): T? {
        return try {
            // Attempt to create instance using no-arg constructor
            entityClass.constructors.firstOrNull { it.parameters.isEmpty() }?.call()
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            null
        }
    }
}
```

#### Advanced KFunction Usage

```kotlin
class FunctionAnalyzer {
    fun analyzeFunction(kFunction: KFunction<*>) {
        println("=== Function Analysis ===")
        println("Name: ${kFunction.name}")
        println("Return type: ${kFunction.returnType}")
        println("Is suspend: ${kFunction.isSuspend}")
        println("Is inline: ${kFunction.isInline}")
        println("Is operator: ${kFunction.isOperator}")
        println("Is infix: ${kFunction.isInfix}")
        
        // Parameters
        println("\nParameters:")
        kFunction.parameters.forEach { param ->
            println("  ${param.name}: ${param.type}")
            println("    Kind: ${param.kind}")
            println("    Is optional: ${param.isOptional}")
            println("    Is vararg: ${param.isVararg}")
        }
        
        // Annotations
        if (kFunction.annotations.isNotEmpty()) {
            println("\nAnnotations:")
            kFunction.annotations.forEach { annotation ->
                println("  $annotation")
            }
        }
    }
}

class MathOperations {
    @ValidateParams(["positive"])
    fun power(base: Double, exponent: Double = 2.0): Double {
        return Math.pow(base, exponent)
    }
    
    operator fun invoke(operation: String, vararg args: Double): Double {
        return when (operation) {
            "power" -> power(args[0], args.getOrElse(1) { 2.0 })
            else -> 0.0
        }
    }
}

fun demonstrateFunctionAnalysis() {
    val mathClass = MathOperations::class
    val powerFunction = mathClass.memberFunctions.find { it.name == "power" }
    
    if (powerFunction != null) {
        val analyzer = FunctionAnalyzer()
        analyzer.analyzeFunction(powerFunction)
    }
}
```

#### Dynamic Object Creation and Manipulation

```kotlin
class ObjectFactory {
    inline fun <reified T : Any> create(vararg args: Any?): T? {
        return create(T::class, *args)
    }
    
    fun <T : Any> create(kClass: KClass<T>, vararg args: Any?): T? {
        return try {
            // Find constructor that matches the number of arguments
            val constructor = kClass.constructors.find { 
                it.parameters.size == args.size 
            }
            
            constructor?.call(*args)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Failed to create instance: ${e.message}")
            null
        }
    }
    
    fun <T : Any> copyWithModifications(
        original: T,
        modifications: Map<String, Any?>
    ): T? {
        val kClass = original::class
        
        // Find primary constructor
        val primaryConstructor = kClass.primaryConstructor ?: return null
        
        // Get current property values
        val currentValues = mutableMapOf<String, Any?>()
        kClass.memberProperties.forEach { property ->
            currentValues[property.name] = property.getter.call(original)
        }
        
        // Apply modifications
        modifications.forEach { (name, value) ->
            currentValues[name] = value
        }
        
        // Create new instance with modified values
        val constructorArgs = primaryConstructor.parameters.map { param ->
            currentValues[param.name]
        }.toTypedArray()
        
        return try {
            primaryConstructor.call(*constructorArgs)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Failed to create modified copy: ${e.message}")
            null
        }
    }
}

data class Product(
    val id: Long,
    val name: String,
    val price: Double,
    val category: String
)

fun demonstrateObjectFactory() {
    val factory = ObjectFactory()
    
    // Create object dynamically
    val product = factory.create<Product>(1L, "Laptop", 999.99, "Electronics")
    println("Created product: $product")
    
    // Create modified copy
    if (product != null) {
        val discountedProduct = factory.copyWithModifications(
            product,
            mapOf("price" to 799.99, "name" to "Laptop (Sale)")
        )
        println("Modified product: $discountedProduct")
    }
}
```

#### Reflection-based Validation Framework

```kotlin
@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class NotNull

@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Size(val min: Int = 0, val max: Int = Int.MAX_VALUE)

@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Range(val min: Double, val max: Double)

class ValidationResult(
    val isValid: Boolean,
    val errors: List<String>
)

class Validator {
    fun validate(obj: Any): ValidationResult {
        val errors = mutableListOf<String>()
        val kClass = obj::class
        
        kClass.memberProperties.forEach { property ->
            val value = property.getter.call(obj)
            
            // Check @NotNull
            if (property.findAnnotation<NotNull>() != null && value == null) {
                errors.add("${property.name} cannot be null")
            }
            
            // Check @Size
            val sizeAnnotation = property.findAnnotation<Size>()
            if (sizeAnnotation != null && value is String) {
                if (value.length < sizeAnnotation.min || value.length > sizeAnnotation.max) {
                    errors.add("${property.name} must be between ${sizeAnnotation.min} and ${sizeAnnotation.max} characters")
                }
            }
            
            // Check @Range
            val rangeAnnotation = property.findAnnotation<Range>()
            if (rangeAnnotation != null && value is Number) {
                val doubleValue = value.toDouble()
                if (doubleValue < rangeAnnotation.min || doubleValue > rangeAnnotation.max) {
                    errors.add("${property.name} must be between ${rangeAnnotation.min} and ${rangeAnnotation.max}")
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ValidationResult(errors.isEmpty(), errors)
    }
}

data class UserProfile(
    @NotNull
    @Size(min = 2, max = 50)
    val username: String?,
    
    @Range(min = 0.0, max = 120.0)
    val age: Int,
    
    @Size(min = 10, max = 200)
    val bio: String
)

fun demonstrateValidation() {
    val validator = Validator()
    
    val validProfile = UserProfile("john_doe", 25, "Software developer")
    val validResult = validator.validate(validProfile)
    println("Valid profile: ${validResult.isValid}")
    
    val invalidProfile = UserProfile(null, 150, "Bio")
    val invalidResult = validator.validate(invalidProfile)
    println("Invalid profile: ${invalidResult.isValid}")
    if (!invalidResult.isValid) {
        println("Errors: ${invalidResult.errors}")
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- Kotlin reflection provides powerful runtime introspection capabilities
- Custom annotations can carry metadata and be processed at runtime
- KClass provides comprehensive class information and manipulation
- KFunction enables dynamic function invocation and analysis
- Reflection enables building frameworks like ORMs and validation systems
- Performance overhead should be considered when using reflection extensively

**Conclusion:** Kotlin's reflection and annotation systems provide the foundation for building sophisticated frameworks and libraries. By combining custom annotations with runtime reflection processing, you can create powerful metaprogramming solutions that reduce boilerplate code and enable declarative programming patterns. Understanding these concepts is essential for advanced Kotlin development and framework creation.

# Interoperability

## Java Interoperability

### Calling Java from Kotlin

Kotlin provides seamless interoperability with Java, allowing direct use of Java classes, methods, and libraries without any special syntax or wrappers. This makes migration from Java to Kotlin gradual and practical.

```kotlin
// Using Java collections directly
val javaList = ArrayList<String>()
javaList.add("Hello")
javaList.add("World")

// Using Java streams
val filteredList = javaList.stream()
    .filter { it.startsWith("H") }
    .collect(Collectors.toList())

// Using Java classes
val date = Date()
val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
val formatter = SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd")
```

#### Static Methods and Fields

```kotlin
// Java static methods become regular function calls
val maxValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE
val parsedInt = Integer.parseInt("123")
val currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis()

// Java static methods with class qualification
val uuid = UUID.randomUUID()
val files = Files.list(Paths.get("/tmp"))
```

#### Method Overloading and Default Parameters

```kotlin
// Java method overloading works naturally
val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
stringBuilder.append("Hello")
stringBuilder.append("World", 0, 5)
stringBuilder.append(42)

// Java methods with multiple overloads
val thread1 = Thread()
val thread2 = Thread("MyThread")
val thread3 = Thread(Runnable { println("Running") })
```

#### Handling Java Exceptions

```kotlin
// Java checked exceptions must be handled
fun readFile(filename: String): String {
    return try {
        Files.readString(Paths.get(filename))
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        "Error reading file: ${e.message}"
    }
}

// Multiple Java exceptions
fun parseAndWrite(input: String, output: String) {
    try {
        val number = Integer.parseInt(input)
        Files.write(Paths.get(output), number.toString().toByteArray())
    } catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
        println("Invalid number format: $input")
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("Failed to write file: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

#### Working with Java Generics

```kotlin
// Java generic types work directly
val map = HashMap<String, Int>()
map["key"] = 42

val list = LinkedList<String>()
list.add("item")

// Java wildcards are handled automatically
fun processList(list: List<*>) {
    for (item in list) {
        println(item)
    }
}

// Working with Java bounded generics
class DataProcessor<T : Comparable<T>> {
    fun process(items: List<T>): T? {
        return items.maxOrNull()
    }
}
```

### Calling Kotlin from Java

Kotlin code can be called from Java with minimal friction, though some Kotlin features require special consideration or annotations to work smoothly with Java.

#### Basic Class Usage

```kotlin
// Kotlin class
class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
    fun greet() = "Hello, I'm $name"
    
    fun celebrateBirthday(): Person {
        return Person(name, age + 1)
    }
}
```

```java
// Java usage
public class JavaMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John", 30);
        System.out.println(person.getName()); // Kotlin val becomes getter
        System.out.println(person.getAge());
        System.out.println(person.greet());
        
        Person olderPerson = person.celebrateBirthday();
    }
}
```

#### Properties and Accessors

```kotlin
class User {
    var name: String = ""
    val id: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
    
    var isActive: Boolean = true
        get() = field && System.currentTimeMillis() < expirationTime
        set(value) {
            field = value
            lastModified = System.currentTimeMillis()
        }
    
    private var lastModified: Long = 0
    private val expirationTime: Long = System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000
}
```

```java
// Java usage
User user = new User();
user.setName("Alice");        // var becomes getter/setter
String name = user.getName();
String id = user.getId();     // val becomes getter only
user.setActive(true);
boolean active = user.isActive(); // Boolean property uses is/set prefix
```

#### Companion Objects and Static Methods

```kotlin
class MathUtils {
    companion object {
        fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
        
        @JvmStatic
        fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a * b
        
        const val PI = 3.14159
    }
}
```

```java
// Java usage
public class JavaMath {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Without @JvmStatic - requires Companion reference
        int sum = MathUtils.Companion.add(5, 3);
        
        // With @JvmStatic - can call directly
        int product = MathUtils.multiply(5, 3);
        
        // Constants work directly
        double pi = MathUtils.PI;
    }
}
```

#### Top-Level Functions

```kotlin
// File: StringUtils.kt
package com.example.utils

fun capitalize(str: String): String {
    return str.replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() }
}

@JvmName("reverseString")
fun reverse(str: String): String {
    return str.reversed()
}
```

```java
// Java usage
import com.example.utils.StringUtilsKt;

public class JavaStringProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String capitalized = StringUtilsKt.capitalize("hello");
        String reversed = StringUtilsKt.reverseString("world");
    }
}
```

#### Extension Functions

```kotlin
// Extension functions are not directly accessible from Java
fun String.isPalindrome(): Boolean {
    return this == this.reversed()
}

// Create a utility class for Java interop
class StringExtensions {
    companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        fun isPalindrome(str: String): Boolean {
            return str == str.reversed()
        }
    }
}
```

```java
// Java usage
boolean result = StringExtensions.isPalindrome("racecar");
```

### Handling Java Nullability

Java's nullable types are represented as platform types in Kotlin, which require careful handling to maintain null safety.

#### Platform Types

```kotlin
// Java method that might return null
fun processJavaString(javaString: String) {
    // javaString has platform type String!
    // Kotlin doesn't know if it's nullable or not
    
    // Safe approach - treat as nullable
    val length = javaString?.length ?: 0
    
    // Risky approach - assume non-null
    val upperCase = javaString.uppercase() // Could throw NPE
}
```

#### Null Checks and Safe Calls

```kotlin
// Working with Java collections that might contain nulls
fun processJavaList(javaList: List<String>) {
    for (item in javaList) {
        // item has platform type String!
        item?.let { safeItem ->
            println("Processing: $safeItem")
        }
    }
}

// Converting platform types to Kotlin nullable types
fun convertPlatformType(javaResult: String): String? {
    return javaResult.takeIf { it.isNotEmpty() }
}
```

#### Defensive Programming with Platform Types

```kotlin
class UserService {
    fun processUser(javaUser: User) {
        // Validate platform type inputs
        val safeName = javaUser.name?.takeIf { it.isNotBlank() }
            ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("User name is required")
        
        val safeEmail = javaUser.email?.takeIf { it.contains("@") }
            ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("Valid email is required")
        
        // Process with validated data
        createKotlinUser(safeName, safeEmail)
    }
}
```

### Platform Types and Annotations

Platform types represent Java types whose nullability is unknown to Kotlin. Annotations can provide nullability information to improve interoperability.

#### JSR-305 Annotations

```java
// Java code with JSR-305 annotations
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;

public class JavaService {
    @Nonnull
    public String getRequiredValue() {
        return "value";
    }
    
    @Nullable
    public String getOptionalValue() {
        return null;
    }
    
    public void processData(@Nonnull String data, @Nullable String metadata) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin usage with annotation information
fun useJavaService(service: JavaService) {
    val required: String = service.requiredValue // Non-null type
    val optional: String? = service.optionalValue // Nullable type
    
    service.processData("data", null) // Accepts null for metadata
}
```

#### Android Support Annotations

```java
// Java code with Android annotations
import androidx.annotation.NonNull;
import androidx.annotation.Nullable;

public class AndroidService {
    @NonNull
    public List<String> getItems() {
        return Arrays.asList("item1", "item2");
    }
    
    @Nullable
    public String findItem(@NonNull String id) {
        return items.get(id);
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin automatically recognizes Android annotations
fun useAndroidService(service: AndroidService) {
    val items: List<String> = service.items // Non-null
    val item: String? = service.findItem("123") // Nullable
}
```

#### JetBrains Annotations

```java
// Java code with JetBrains annotations
import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

public class DataRepository {
    @NotNull
    public User createUser(@NotNull String name, @Nullable String email) {
        return new User(name, email);
    }
    
    @Nullable
    public User findUser(@NotNull String id) {
        return database.findById(id);
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin respects JetBrains annotations
fun useRepository(repository: DataRepository) {
    val user: User = repository.createUser("John", null)
    val foundUser: User? = repository.findUser("123")
}
```

#### Custom Nullability Annotations

```java
// Define custom annotations
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD})
public @interface NonNull {}

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.FIELD})
public @interface Nullable {}

// Use in Java code
public class CustomService {
    @NonNull
    public String process(@NonNull String input, @Nullable String options) {
        return input.toUpperCase();
    }
}
```

#### Configuring Nullability Annotations

```kotlin
// Configure annotation recognition in build script
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
        freeCompilerArgs += [
            "-Xjsr305=strict",
            "-Xtype-enhancement-improvements-strict-mode"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Advanced Interoperability Patterns

#### Functional Interfaces and SAM Conversion

```kotlin
// Java functional interface
interface Processor {
    fun process(input: String): String
}

// Kotlin can use lambda for SAM conversion
fun useProcessor() {
    val processor = Processor { input ->
        input.uppercase()
    }
    
    // Or method reference
    val anotherProcessor = Processor(String::lowercase)
}
```

#### Handling Java Varargs

```kotlin
// Java method with varargs
fun callJavaVarargs() {
    val formatter = Formatter()
    
    // Pass individual arguments
    formatter.format("Hello %s, age %d", "John", 30)
    
    // Pass array with spread operator
    val args = arrayOf("Jane", 25)
    formatter.format("Hello %s, age %d", *args)
}
```

#### Working with Java Builders

```kotlin
// Using Java builder pattern
fun createHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {
    return OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .connectTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .readTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .addInterceptor(LoggingInterceptor())
        .build()
}
```

**Key points:**

- Java code can be called directly from Kotlin without special syntax
- Kotlin properties become getters/setters in Java
- Platform types require careful null handling
- Annotations provide nullability information for better interoperability
- @JvmStatic and @JvmName annotations improve Java usage of Kotlin code

**Example** of comprehensive Java interoperability:

```kotlin
// Kotlin service that works well with Java
class UserManagementService {
    private val users = mutableMapOf<String, User>()
    
    @JvmOverloads
    fun createUser(
        name: String,
        email: String? = null,
        age: Int = 0
    ): User {
        val user = User(name, email, age)
        users[user.id] = user
        return user
    }
    
    @JvmName("findUserById")
    fun findUser(id: String): User? {
        return users[id]
    }
    
    @JvmStatic
    fun validateEmail(email: String?): Boolean {
        return email?.contains("@") == true
    }
    
    companion object {
        @JvmField
        val DEFAULT_AGE = 18
        
        @JvmStatic
        fun createService(): UserManagementService {
            return UserManagementService()
        }
    }
}

// Data class with Java-friendly design
data class User(
    val name: String,
    val email: String?,
    val age: Int
) {
    val id: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
    
    @JvmName("hasEmail")
    fun hasEmail(): Boolean = email != null
}
```

```java
// Java usage of Kotlin code
public class JavaUserManager {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserManagementService service = UserManagementService.createService();
        
        // Use overloaded methods
        User user1 = service.createUser("John");
        User user2 = service.createUser("Jane", "jane@example.com");
        User user3 = service.createUser("Bob", "bob@example.com", 25);
        
        // Use renamed method
        User found = service.findUserById(user1.getId());
        
        // Use static method
        boolean isValid = UserManagementService.validateEmail("test@example.com");
        
        // Use static field
        int defaultAge = UserManagementService.DEFAULT_AGE;
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**

Java interoperability is one of Kotlin's strongest features, enabling seamless integration with existing Java codebases and libraries. Understanding platform types, proper annotation usage, and interop-friendly API design patterns ensures smooth collaboration between Java and Kotlin code. The key is to be mindful of nullability when working with Java APIs and to use appropriate annotations and naming conventions when exposing Kotlin APIs to Java consumers.

## Platform-Specific Features

### JVM-Specific Features

Kotlin on the JVM provides seamless interoperability with existing Java code while adding powerful language features that leverage JVM capabilities.

#### Java Interoperability

Kotlin can call Java code directly without any wrapper or conversion layer. Java classes, methods, and fields are accessible using standard Kotlin syntax. When calling Java methods that can return null, Kotlin treats the return type as nullable unless annotated with nullability annotations.

```kotlin
// Calling Java code from Kotlin
val list = ArrayList<String>()
list.add("Hello")
val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
val date = calendar.time
```

Kotlin properties are accessible from Java as getter/setter methods following JavaBean conventions. The `@JvmName` annotation allows customizing the generated method names, while `@JvmStatic` makes companion object members accessible as static methods in Java.

```kotlin
class KotlinClass {
    @JvmName("getSpecialName")
    val property: String = "value"
    
    companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        fun staticMethod() = "static"
    }
}
```

#### JVM Annotations and Reflection

Kotlin provides JVM-specific annotations to control bytecode generation and Java interoperability. The `@JvmField` annotation exposes a property as a public field in bytecode, while `@JvmOverloads` generates overloaded methods for functions with default parameters.

```kotlin
class Example {
    @JvmField
    val publicField = "accessible from Java"
    
    @JvmOverloads
    fun method(param1: String, param2: Int = 0) {
        // Generates multiple Java methods
    }
}
```

Kotlin's reflection API on the JVM provides runtime introspection capabilities. The `::class` syntax gives access to KClass objects, while `::` can create callable references to functions and properties.

```kotlin
val kClass = String::class
val members = kClass.members
val function = ::println
val property = Person::name
```

#### Threading and Concurrency

On the JVM, Kotlin coroutines are implemented using thread pools and continuation-passing style. The default dispatchers map to different thread pools: `Dispatchers.Default` uses a shared thread pool for CPU-intensive work, `Dispatchers.IO` uses a larger pool for I/O operations, and `Dispatchers.Main` integrates with UI frameworks.

```kotlin
// JVM-specific thread pool configuration
val customDispatcher = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4).asCoroutineDispatcher()

launch(customDispatcher) {
    // Work on custom thread pool
}
```

#### Bytecode Generation and Optimization

Kotlin generates efficient JVM bytecode that's often equivalent to hand-written Java. Inline functions are expanded at call sites, eliminating function call overhead. The `@JvmInline` annotation creates value classes that are erased at runtime when possible.

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class UserId(val id: String)

inline fun <T> measureTime(block: () -> T): T {
    val start = System.nanoTime()
    return block().also {
        println("Time: ${System.nanoTime() - start}ns")
    }
}
```

### Android-Specific Considerations

Android development with Kotlin involves platform-specific APIs, lifecycle management, and performance considerations unique to mobile environments.

#### Android Extensions and View Binding

While Android synthetic properties are deprecated, View Binding provides type-safe access to views. The binding classes are generated automatically and provide direct references to views without findViewById calls.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        
        binding.textView.text = "Hello World"
    }
}
```

#### Coroutines and Android Lifecycle

Android provides lifecycle-aware coroutine scopes that automatically cancel when the lifecycle owner is destroyed. `lifecycleScope` and `viewModelScope` prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        lifecycleScope.launch {
            // Automatically cancelled when activity is destroyed
            val data = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
                loadData()
            }
            updateUI(data)
        }
    }
}

class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    fun loadData() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            // Automatically cancelled when ViewModel is cleared
            repository.getData()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Android-Specific APIs

Kotlin provides extension functions and properties for common Android patterns. Intent creation, SharedPreferences access, and resource handling are streamlined with Kotlin's syntax.

```kotlin
// Intent creation
val intent = Intent(this, MainActivity::class.java).apply {
    putExtra("key", "value")
}

// SharedPreferences
val prefs = getSharedPreferences("app_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
prefs.edit {
    putString("username", "john")
    putBoolean("logged_in", true)
}

// Resource access
val color = ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.primary)
val string = getString(R.string.app_name)
```

#### Performance Considerations

Android apps have strict performance requirements due to limited resources and battery constraints. Kotlin's compilation to efficient bytecode helps, but developers must consider object allocation, garbage collection, and main thread blocking.

```kotlin
// Efficient collection operations
val result = list.asSequence()
    .filter { it.isValid }
    .map { it.transform() }
    .take(10)
    .toList()

// Avoid allocations in hot paths
class RecyclerAdapter : RecyclerView.Adapter<ViewHolder>() {
    private val reusableIntent = Intent()
    
    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        // Reuse objects to avoid garbage collection pressure
    }
}
```

### Kotlin/Native Basics

Kotlin/Native compiles Kotlin code to native binaries without requiring a virtual machine, enabling deployment to platforms where the JVM isn't available.

#### Native Compilation Model

Kotlin/Native uses LLVM as its backend, producing native executables for various platforms including Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, and embedded systems. The compilation process includes whole-program optimization and dead code elimination.

```kotlin
// Native-specific annotations
@ThreadLocal
var globalVariable: String = ""

@SharedImmutable
val sharedConstant = "immutable data"

@ExperimentalForeignApi
external fun nativeFunction(): Int
```

#### Memory Management

Kotlin/Native uses automatic memory management with a concurrent mark-and-sweep garbage collector. Objects are allocated on the heap, and the runtime handles deallocation automatically. The memory model supports both shared and thread-local objects.

```kotlin
// Memory management in Native
class NativeClass {
    private val data = ByteArray(1024)
    
    fun processData() {
        // Memory is automatically managed
        val temp = data.copyOf()
        // temp is collected when no longer referenced
    }
}
```

#### Platform-Specific APIs

Kotlin/Native provides access to platform-specific APIs through expect/actual declarations and C interop. The cinterop tool generates Kotlin bindings for C libraries, enabling access to system APIs.

```kotlin
// Platform-specific implementation
actual fun getCurrentTimestamp(): Long {
    return platform.posix.time(null)
}

// C interop
@OptIn(ExperimentalForeignApi::class)
fun callNativeLibrary() {
    val result = nativeLibrary.someFunction()
}
```

#### Concurrency in Native

Kotlin/Native's concurrency model is based on isolated mutability and shared immutable state. Objects are either mutable and confined to a single thread or immutable and shareable across threads.

```kotlin
// Worker-based concurrency
val worker = Worker.start()
val future = worker.execute(TransferMode.SAFE, { "data" }) {
    // This runs on worker thread
    it.uppercase()
}
val result = future.result
```

### Multiplatform Project Setup

Kotlin Multiplatform enables sharing code between different platforms while maintaining platform-specific implementations where needed.

#### Project Structure

A typical multiplatform project consists of common source sets containing shared code and platform-specific source sets for platform implementations. The hierarchy allows for intermediate source sets that target subsets of platforms.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    jvm()
    js(IR) {
        browser()
        nodejs()
    }
    
    iosX64()
    iosArm64()
    iosSimulatorArm64()
    
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.7.3")
            }
        }
        
        jvmMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm:1.7.3")
            }
        }
        
        jsMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-js:1.7.3")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Expected and Actual Declarations

The expect/actual mechanism allows declaring common APIs in shared code with platform-specific implementations. Expected declarations define the contract, while actual declarations provide the implementation.

```kotlin
// commonMain
expect fun getPlatformName(): String
expect class Platform {
    fun getVersion(): String
}

// jvmMain
actual fun getPlatformName(): String = "JVM"
actual class Platform {
    actual fun getVersion(): String = System.getProperty("java.version")
}

// jsMain
actual fun getPlatformName(): String = "JavaScript"
actual class Platform {
    actual fun getVersion(): String = js("process.version")
}
```

#### Shared Libraries and Dependencies

Multiplatform libraries provide common APIs that work across platforms. Popular libraries like kotlinx.coroutines, kotlinx.serialization, and Ktor offer multiplatform support with platform-specific optimizations.

```kotlin
// Common networking code
class ApiClient {
    private val httpClient = HttpClient()
    
    suspend fun getData(): ApiResponse {
        return httpClient.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    }
}

// Common serialization
@Serializable
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)

val json = Json.encodeToString(User("John", 30))
```

#### Platform-Specific Modules

Each platform can have its own module with platform-specific dependencies and implementations. This allows leveraging platform-specific features while maintaining shared business logic.

```kotlin
// Android-specific module
android {
    compileSdk = 34
    
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 21
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.12.0")
    implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.7.0")
}

// iOS-specific configuration
iosMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-iosarm64:1.7.3")
    }
}
```

#### Testing Multiplatform Code

Multiplatform projects support testing common code with platform-specific test implementations. The testing framework runs tests on all configured platforms, ensuring consistent behavior.

```kotlin
// commonTest
class CommonTest {
    @Test
    fun testSharedLogic() {
        val result = SharedLogic.process("input")
        assertEquals("expected", result)
    }
}

// jvmTest
class JvmSpecificTest {
    @Test
    fun testJvmImplementation() {
        val platform = Platform()
        assertTrue(platform.getVersion().isNotEmpty())
    }
}
```

**Key points**: JVM features provide seamless Java interoperability with powerful reflection and concurrency capabilities. Android development leverages lifecycle-aware coroutines and platform-specific APIs for optimal mobile performance. Kotlin/Native enables native compilation with automatic memory management and platform-specific API access. Multiplatform projects share code across platforms using expect/actual declarations while maintaining platform-specific optimizations.

# Performance and Best Practices

## Performance Optimization in Kotlin

### Inline Functions and When to Use Them

Inline functions are a powerful Kotlin feature that can significantly improve performance by eliminating function call overhead. When a function is marked with the `inline` keyword, the compiler replaces the function call with the actual function body at compile time, similar to C++ inline functions or C macros, but with type safety.

The primary benefit of inline functions becomes apparent when working with higher-order functions that accept lambda parameters. Without inlining, each lambda creates a function object, which involves heap allocation and method dispatch overhead. Inline functions eliminate this overhead by expanding both the function body and the lambda code directly at the call site.

```kotlin
// Non-inline function creates function objects
fun measureTime(block: () -> Unit): Long {
    val start = System.nanoTime()
    block()
    return System.nanoTime() - start
}

// Inline function eliminates function object creation
inline fun measureTimeInline(block: () -> Unit): Long {
    val start = System.nanoTime()
    block()
    return System.nanoTime() - start
}
```

The compiler applies specific rules when determining whether to inline a function. Functions with lambda parameters are prime candidates for inlining, especially when the lambda is called multiple times within the function body. However, the compiler may refuse to inline functions that are too large, as this could lead to code bloat.

**Key points** for effective inline function usage include understanding that inline functions with lambda parameters can contain non-local returns, allowing lambdas to return from the calling function. This behavior can be controlled using the `crossinline` keyword when non-local returns should be prohibited, or `noinline` for specific parameters that shouldn't be inlined.

The `reified` keyword works exclusively with inline functions and allows type parameters to be accessed at runtime. This enables operations that would normally require explicit class parameters due to type erasure, such as checking instance types or creating arrays of generic types.

```kotlin
inline fun <reified T> isInstance(value: Any): Boolean {
    return value is T
}

inline fun <reified T> createArray(size: Int): Array<T?> {
    return arrayOfNulls<T>(size)
}
```

Performance considerations for inline functions include recognizing that inlining increases bytecode size, which can impact method cache performance and class loading times. Inline functions should be used judiciously, primarily for small functions with lambda parameters or functions called frequently in performance-critical paths.

### Memory Management Considerations

Kotlin's memory management builds upon the JVM's garbage collection system while introducing additional considerations specific to Kotlin's language features. Understanding these aspects is crucial for writing performant Kotlin applications that minimize garbage collection pressure and memory leaks.

Object allocation patterns in Kotlin can significantly impact performance. Data classes, while convenient, create new objects for each instance, which can lead to excessive allocation in performance-critical code. The `copy()` method on data classes creates entirely new objects, which may not be optimal for frequently modified data structures.

```kotlin
// Potentially expensive for frequent modifications
data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int)

// More efficient for mutable scenarios
class MutablePoint(var x: Int, var y: Int) {
    fun set(newX: Int, newY: Int) {
        x = newX
        y = newY
    }
}
```

Lambda expressions and higher-order functions can create hidden allocations. Each lambda that captures variables from its enclosing scope creates a closure object that holds references to those variables. This can lead to unexpected memory retention and increased garbage collection pressure.

**Key points** for memory optimization include understanding that Kotlin's null safety features, while beneficial for correctness, can introduce wrapper objects in certain scenarios. The `?.` operator and `?:` operator should be used thoughtfully in performance-critical code where alternatives might be more efficient.

String handling requires special attention in Kotlin applications. String concatenation using the `+` operator creates intermediate String objects, which can be expensive in loops. The `StringBuilder` class or string templates should be used for building strings incrementally.

```kotlin
// Inefficient string building
fun buildStringInefficient(items: List<String>): String {
    var result = ""
    for (item in items) {
        result += item + ", "
    }
    return result
}

// Efficient string building
fun buildStringEfficient(items: List<String>): String {
    return buildString {
        for (item in items) {
            append(item)
            append(", ")
        }
    }
}
```

Memory leaks in Kotlin applications often stem from holding references to objects longer than necessary. Common patterns include listeners not being properly unregistered, static references to activities or contexts in Android applications, and closures capturing more variables than needed.

### Collection Performance Characteristics

Kotlin's collection framework provides multiple implementations with different performance characteristics. Understanding these differences is essential for choosing the right collection type for specific use cases and avoiding performance bottlenecks.

Lists in Kotlin come in several flavors with distinct performance profiles. `ArrayList` provides O(1) random access and amortized O(1) append operations, making it suitable for scenarios requiring frequent element access by index. However, insertions and deletions in the middle of the list are O(n) operations due to element shifting.

`LinkedList` offers O(1) insertion and deletion at known positions but O(n) random access. This makes it suitable for scenarios involving frequent insertions and deletions but poor for random access patterns. The choice between ArrayList and LinkedList should be based on the predominant access patterns in the application.

```kotlin
// ArrayList: Good for random access, poor for middle insertions
val arrayList = arrayListOf<String>()
arrayList.add("item") // O(1) amortized
val item = arrayList[0] // O(1)
arrayList.add(0, "new") // O(n)

// LinkedList: Good for insertions, poor for random access
val linkedList = linkedListOf<String>()
linkedList.add("item") // O(1)
val item = linkedList[0] // O(n)
linkedList.add(0, "new") // O(1) if at beginning
```

Set implementations provide different performance guarantees. `HashSet` offers O(1) average-case performance for basic operations but requires good hash function distribution. `LinkedHashSet` maintains insertion order while preserving HashSet's performance characteristics. `TreeSet` provides O(log n) operations with sorted order guarantees.

Map implementations follow similar patterns. `HashMap` provides O(1) average-case performance for get and put operations, making it suitable for most use cases. `LinkedHashMap` maintains insertion or access order with slightly higher memory overhead. `TreeMap` provides sorted keys with O(log n) performance for basic operations.

**Key points** for collection performance include understanding that immutable collections in Kotlin may share structure between instances, providing memory efficiency benefits. However, operations that require modifications create new instances, which can be expensive for large collections.

Sequence operations in Kotlin provide lazy evaluation, which can significantly improve performance when chaining multiple operations. Unlike collections that eagerly evaluate each operation, sequences process elements on-demand, reducing intermediate collection creation.

```kotlin
// Eager evaluation: creates intermediate collections
val result = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    .filter { it > 2 }
    .map { it * 2 }
    .take(2)

// Lazy evaluation: processes elements on-demand
val result = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    .asSequence()
    .filter { it > 2 }
    .map { it * 2 }
    .take(2)
    .toList()
```

### Profiling Kotlin Applications

Profiling is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks in Kotlin applications. The JVM provides robust profiling tools that work effectively with Kotlin code, though some Kotlin-specific considerations must be understood for accurate performance analysis.

JVM profilers like JProfiler, YourKit, and VisualVM provide comprehensive insights into Kotlin application performance. These tools can identify CPU hotspots, memory allocation patterns, and garbage collection behavior. Understanding how Kotlin constructs translate to JVM bytecode helps interpret profiler results accurately.

Method profiling reveals which functions consume the most CPU time. Kotlin's inline functions may not appear in profiler results since they're expanded at compile time, which can make tracing performance issues more challenging. The `@JvmName` annotation can help identify specific methods in profiler output when dealing with overloaded functions or extension functions.

```kotlin
// May be difficult to identify in profiler due to name mangling
fun String.processText(): String = this.trim().toLowerCase()

// Easier to identify in profiler
@JvmName("processTextString")
fun String.processText(): String = this.trim().toLowerCase()
```

Memory profiling helps identify allocation patterns and potential memory leaks. Kotlin's object creation patterns, including data classes and lambda expressions, can create unexpected allocation hotspots. Profilers can reveal when seemingly innocent code creates excessive objects or retains references longer than necessary.

**Key points** for effective profiling include understanding that Kotlin coroutines require special consideration during profiling. Coroutine suspension and resumption can make call stacks appear fragmented in traditional profilers. Specialized tools or profiler plugins may be needed for accurate coroutine profiling.

Microbenchmarking Kotlin code requires careful attention to JVM warmup and optimization behavior. The JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) framework provides accurate benchmarking capabilities that account for JIT compilation and other JVM optimizations. Kotlin-specific benchmarking considerations include understanding how inline functions and lambda expressions affect benchmark results.

```kotlin
@BenchmarkMode(Mode.AverageTime)
@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)
@State(Scope.Benchmark)
class StringBenchmark {
    
    @Benchmark
    fun stringConcatenation(): String {
        return "Hello" + " " + "World"
    }
    
    @Benchmark
    fun stringTemplate(): String {
        return "Hello World"
    }
    
    @Benchmark
    fun stringBuilder(): String {
        return StringBuilder().append("Hello").append(" ").append("World").toString()
    }
}
```

Application performance monitoring (APM) tools provide production-level insights into Kotlin application performance. These tools can identify performance regressions, track key performance indicators, and provide alerts when performance thresholds are exceeded.

**Conclusion**

Performance optimization in Kotlin requires understanding the language's unique features and their impact on runtime behavior. Inline functions provide powerful optimization opportunities but must be used judiciously to avoid code bloat. Memory management considerations extend beyond basic garbage collection to include Kotlin-specific allocation patterns and reference retention issues. Collection performance characteristics vary significantly between implementations, requiring careful selection based on usage patterns. Profiling tools provide essential insights into application behavior, though Kotlin-specific features require special consideration for accurate analysis. Effective performance optimization combines these technical considerations with thorough measurement and testing to ensure optimizations provide real-world benefits.

## Code Quality

### Kotlin Coding Conventions

Kotlin follows specific naming and formatting conventions that enhance code readability and maintainability. Package names use lowercase with no underscores, following reverse domain notation like `com.company.project`. Class names employ PascalCase, while function and property names use camelCase. Constants are written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

Indentation uses 4 spaces rather than tabs, with continuation indentation also at 4 spaces. Line length should not exceed 120 characters, with longer expressions broken at logical points. When chaining method calls, the dot operator begins each new line and is aligned with the previous call.

File organization follows a specific order: copyright header, package declaration, imports (grouped by type), and top-level declarations. Class members are ordered by visibility (public first), then by type (properties before functions), with companion objects placed last.

### Effective Kotlin Patterns

Kotlin offers numerous patterns that leverage its unique features for cleaner, more expressive code. The Elvis operator (`?:`) provides concise null handling, while safe calls (`?.`) prevent null pointer exceptions. Scope functions like `let`, `apply`, `run`, `also`, and `with` each serve specific purposes in object transformation and configuration.

Data classes automatically generate `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `copy()` methods, eliminating boilerplate code. Sealed classes enable exhaustive when expressions and provide type-safe alternatives to enums with associated data. Extension functions allow adding functionality to existing classes without inheritance.

Higher-order functions and lambdas enable functional programming patterns. Collection processing becomes more expressive with functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `fold`. Delegation patterns using `by` keyword reduce boilerplate in property delegation and class delegation scenarios.

### Code Smell Identification

Kotlin-specific code smells often involve misusing language features or ignoring idiomatic patterns. Overuse of nullable types when non-null alternatives exist indicates poor null safety design. Excessive use of `!!` (not-null assertion) suggests inadequate null handling strategy and potential runtime crashes.

Long parameter lists in functions indicate poor abstraction, often solved by introducing parameter objects or builder patterns. Platform types (types coming from Java without null annotations) should be properly handled rather than ignored. Mutable collections exposed as public properties violate encapsulation principles.

Overuse of inheritance when composition would be more appropriate creates tight coupling. Functions that are too long or have too many responsibilities violate single responsibility principle. Duplicate code across similar classes suggests missing abstractions or common interfaces.

### Refactoring Techniques

Extract function refactoring breaks down complex methods into smaller, focused units. This improves readability and enables better testing. Extract class refactoring moves related functionality into separate classes when classes become too large or handle multiple responsibilities.

Introduce parameter object refactoring replaces long parameter lists with objects containing related parameters. This improves method signatures and makes the code more maintainable. Replace conditional with polymorphism eliminates complex conditional logic by leveraging inheritance and interface implementation.

Null object pattern eliminates null checks by providing default implementations. Replace magic numbers with named constants improves code clarity and maintainability. Introduce extension functions to add functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code.

**Key points:**

- Follow Kotlin naming conventions consistently across the codebase
- Leverage Kotlin's null safety features properly with minimal use of force unwrapping
- Use appropriate scope functions for their intended purposes
- Apply functional programming concepts where they improve code clarity
- Identify and address code smells early in development
- Refactor regularly to maintain code quality and prevent technical debt

**Example:**

```kotlin
// Poor code quality
class UserManager {
    fun processUser(name: String?, email: String?, age: Int?) {
        if (name != null && email != null && age != null) {
            if (age >= 18) {
                // Process adult user
                println("Processing adult user: $name")
            } else {
                // Process minor user
                println("Processing minor user: $name")
            }
        }
    }
}

// Improved code quality
data class User(val name: String, val email: String, val age: Int) {
    val isAdult: Boolean get() = age >= 18
}

class UserProcessor {
    fun processUser(user: User) {
        when {
            user.isAdult -> processAdultUser(user)
            else -> processMinorUser(user)
        }
    }
    
    private fun processAdultUser(user: User) {
        println("Processing adult user: ${user.name}")
    }
    
    private fun processMinorUser(user: User) {
        println("Processing minor user: ${user.name}")
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:** Maintaining high code quality in Kotlin requires understanding both general programming principles and Kotlin-specific idioms. Regular code reviews, automated linting, and continuous refactoring help maintain clean, maintainable codebases that leverage Kotlin's powerful features effectively.

# Advanced Topics

## Advanced Generics in Kotlin

### Higher-Kinded Types Concepts

Higher-kinded types represent types that take other types as parameters, creating abstractions over type constructors. While Kotlin doesn't have native higher-kinded types like Haskell or Scala, understanding these concepts helps with functional programming patterns and library design.

```kotlin
// Conceptual representation of higher-kinded types
// Kind * -> * (takes one type, returns another type)
interface Functor<F<*>> {
    fun <A, B> map(fa: F<A>, f: (A) -> B): F<B>
}

// Implementation for List (if Kotlin supported HKT)
class ListFunctor : Functor<List> {
    override fun <A, B> map(fa: List<A>, f: (A) -> B): List<B> = fa.map(f)
}
```

Kotlin achieves similar patterns through:

```kotlin
// Using sealed classes and generic interfaces
sealed class Either<out L, out R> {
    data class Left<out L>(val value: L) : Either<L, Nothing>()
    data class Right<out R>(val value: R) : Either<Nothing, R>()
}

// Generic operations
fun <L, R, T> Either<L, R>.map(f: (R) -> T): Either<L, T> = when (this) {
    is Either.Left -> this
    is Either.Right -> Either.Right(f(value))
}

// Type class pattern using interfaces
interface Mappable<T> {
    fun <R> map(f: (T) -> R): Mappable<R>
}
```

### Type Projections

Type projections allow you to work with generic types when you don't know the exact type parameter, using `out` (covariance) and `in` (contravariance) keywords.

#### Covariant Projections (out)

```kotlin
// Producer - can only produce T, not consume
class Producer<out T>(private val value: T) {
    fun produce(): T = value
    // fun consume(item: T) {} // Not allowed - would break covariance
}

// Usage with projections
fun processProducers(producers: List<Producer<out Any>>) {
    producers.forEach { producer ->
        val item = producer.produce()
        println(item)
    }
}

// Wildcard projections
fun copyFrom(source: Array<out Any>, dest: Array<Any>) {
    for (i in source.indices) {
        dest[i] = source[i]
    }
}
```

#### Contravariant Projections (in)

```kotlin
// Consumer - can only consume T, not produce
class Consumer<in T> {
    fun consume(item: T) {
        // Process item
    }
    // fun produce(): T // Not allowed - would break contravariance
}

// Usage
fun processConsumers(consumers: List<Consumer<in String>>) {
    consumers.forEach { consumer ->
        consumer.consume("Hello")
    }
}

// Contravariant function types
fun processCallback(callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    callback("Hello")
}

// Can pass more general callback
val generalCallback: (Any) -> Unit = { println(it) }
processCallback(generalCallback) // Works due to contravariance
```

#### Star Projections

```kotlin
// Star projection - unknown type
fun processUnknownList(list: List<*>) {
    // Can read as Any?
    list.forEach { item ->
        println(item?.toString())
    }
    // Cannot add items - type is unknown
}

// Complex projections
class Container<T> {
    private val items = mutableListOf<T>()
    
    fun add(item: T) = items.add(item)
    fun get(index: Int): T = items[index]
    fun size(): Int = items.size
}

fun mergeContainers(
    source: Container<out Number>,
    destination: Container<in Number>
) {
    for (i in 0 until source.size()) {
        destination.add(source.get(i))
    }
}
```

### Complex Generic Scenarios

#### Self-Referencing Generics

```kotlin
// Fluent builder pattern
abstract class Builder<T : Builder<T>> {
    abstract fun self(): T
    
    fun commonMethod(): T {
        // Common logic
        return self()
    }
}

class PersonBuilder : Builder<PersonBuilder>() {
    private var name: String = ""
    private var age: Int = 0
    
    override fun self(): PersonBuilder = this
    
    fun name(name: String): PersonBuilder {
        this.name = name
        return self()
    }
    
    fun age(age: Int): PersonBuilder {
        this.age = age
        return self()
    }
    
    fun build(): Person = Person(name, age)
}

// Usage
val person = PersonBuilder()
    .name("John")
    .age(25)
    .commonMethod()
    .build()
```

#### Multiple Type Parameters with Constraints

```kotlin
// Multiple bounds
interface Comparable<in T>
interface Serializable

fun <T> processItem(item: T) 
    where T : Comparable<T>, 
          T : Serializable,
          T : Any {
    // T must be comparable, serializable, and non-null
}

// Generic type relationships
class Repository<T, ID> where T : Entity<ID> {
    fun save(entity: T): T {
        // Save logic
        return entity
    }
    
    fun findById(id: ID): T? {
        // Find logic
        return null
    }
}

abstract class Entity<ID> {
    abstract val id: ID
}

data class User(override val id: Long, val name: String) : Entity<Long>()
```

#### Generic Type Inference Edge Cases

```kotlin
// Type inference with complex hierarchies
class Box<T>(val value: T)

fun <T> createBox(value: T): Box<T> = Box(value)

// Inference works
val stringBox = createBox("Hello") // Box<String>
val intBox = createBox(42) // Box<Int>

// Complex inference scenarios
fun <T> processMultiple(vararg items: T): List<T> = items.toList()

// Type inference with nullable types
fun <T> processNullable(item: T?): T? = item

// Requires explicit type when ambiguous
val result: String? = processNullable(null)

// Generic extension functions
fun <T> List<T>.secondOrNull(): T? = if (size > 1) this[1] else null

// Type inference with receivers
fun <T> T.applyIf(condition: Boolean, block: T.() -> T): T =
    if (condition) block() else this
```

### Phantom Types

Phantom types are type parameters that don't appear in the runtime representation but provide compile-time type safety.

#### State Machine with Phantom Types

```kotlin
// Phantom type for state tracking
sealed class State
object Uninitialized : State()
object Initialized : State()
object Running : State()
object Stopped : State()

class StateMachine<S : State> private constructor(
    private val data: String
) {
    companion object {
        fun create(): StateMachine<Uninitialized> = 
            StateMachine("")
    }
    
    // Only available in Uninitialized state
    fun initialize(data: String): StateMachine<Initialized> = 
        StateMachine(data)
    
    // Only available in Initialized state  
    fun StateMachine<Initialized>.start(): StateMachine<Running> =
        StateMachine(data)
    
    // Only available in Running state
    fun StateMachine<Running>.stop(): StateMachine<Stopped> =
        StateMachine(data)
    
    // Only available in Stopped state
    fun StateMachine<Stopped>.restart(): StateMachine<Running> =
        StateMachine(data)
}

// Usage - compiler enforces state transitions
val machine = StateMachine.create()
    .initialize("config")
    .start()
    .stop()
    .restart()
// machine.initialize("") // Compile error - not in correct state
```

#### Unit Types for Measurement

```kotlin
// Phantom types for units
sealed class Unit
object Meter : Unit()
object Foot : Unit()
object Celsius : Unit()
object Fahrenheit : Unit()

data class Measurement<U : Unit>(val value: Double) {
    operator fun plus(other: Measurement<U>): Measurement<U> =
        Measurement(value + other.value)
}

// Type-safe conversions
fun Measurement<Foot>.toMeters(): Measurement<Meter> =
    Measurement(value * 0.3048)

fun Measurement<Celsius>.toFahrenheit(): Measurement<Fahrenheit> =
    Measurement(value * 9/5 + 32)

// Usage
val distance1 = Measurement<Meter>(10.0)
val distance2 = Measurement<Meter>(5.0)
val totalDistance = distance1 + distance2 // Type-safe

val feetMeasurement = Measurement<Foot>(33.0)
val metersMeasurement = feetMeasurement.toMeters()

// val invalid = distance1 + feetMeasurement // Compile error
```

#### Capability-Based Security

```kotlin
// Phantom types for permissions
sealed class Permission
object ReadPermission : Permission()
object WritePermission : Permission()
object AdminPermission : Permission()

class SecureResource<P : Permission>(private val data: String) {
    
    // Only readable with read permission
    fun read(): String where P : ReadPermission = data
    
    // Only writable with write permission
    fun write(newData: String): SecureResource<P> where P : WritePermission =
        SecureResource(newData)
    
    // Only deletable with admin permission
    fun delete(): Unit where P : AdminPermission = Unit
}

// Permission granting
fun <P : Permission> grantPermission(resource: SecureResource<Permission>): SecureResource<P> =
    SecureResource(resource.toString())

// Usage
val resource: SecureResource<ReadPermission> = grantPermission(SecureResource("data"))
val content = resource.read() // Allowed

// val updated = resource.write("new") // Compile error - no write permission
```

**Key points**:

- Higher-kinded types enable powerful abstractions but require workarounds in Kotlin
- Type projections (`out`, `in`, `*`) provide flexibility while maintaining type safety
- Complex generic scenarios often involve multiple constraints and self-referencing types
- Phantom types provide compile-time guarantees without runtime overhead
- Understanding variance and projections is crucial for designing robust APIs

**Example** of combining these concepts:

```kotlin
// Advanced generic repository pattern
interface Repository<T, ID> where T : Entity<ID> {
    fun save(entity: T): T
    fun findById(id: ID): T?
    fun findAll(): List<T>
}

// Phantom type for query state
sealed class QueryState
object Unprepared : QueryState()
object Prepared : QueryState()

class TypedQuery<T, S : QueryState> private constructor(
    private val sql: String,
    private val parameters: Map<String, Any> = emptyMap()
) {
    companion object {
        fun <T> create(sql: String): TypedQuery<T, Unprepared> = 
            TypedQuery(sql)
    }
    
    fun bind(key: String, value: Any): TypedQuery<T, Prepared> =
        TypedQuery(sql, parameters + (key to value))
    
    fun execute(): List<T> where S : Prepared {
        // Execute query with parameters
        return emptyList()
    }
}
```

Understanding these advanced generic concepts enables building more expressive, type-safe APIs while maintaining runtime performance and compile-time guarantees.

## Compiler Plugins

### Understanding Compiler Plugins

Compiler plugins extend the Kotlin compiler's functionality by modifying the compilation process, adding new language features, or generating additional code. They operate at the compiler level, transforming abstract syntax trees (AST) and bytecode during compilation.

#### Plugin Architecture

Kotlin compiler plugins integrate into the compilation pipeline through well-defined extension points. The compiler provides hooks for different phases: frontend analysis, backend code generation, and IR (Intermediate Representation) transformation. Plugins can modify existing code, generate new declarations, or add metadata to compiled classes.

The plugin system uses a registration mechanism where plugins declare their capabilities and the compiler loads them during compilation. Each plugin implements specific interfaces that correspond to different compilation phases, allowing fine-grained control over the transformation process.

```kotlin
// Plugin registration in build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm")
    kotlin("plugin.serialization")
    kotlin("plugin.allopen")
    kotlin("plugin.noarg")
}
```

#### Compilation Phases

The Kotlin compiler operates in multiple phases, each offering different transformation opportunities. The frontend phase handles parsing, semantic analysis, and type checking. The backend phase generates target-specific code, whether JVM bytecode, JavaScript, or native binaries.

Plugins can hook into these phases to analyze code structure, validate custom annotations, or generate supplementary code. The IR phase, introduced in recent Kotlin versions, provides a unified intermediate representation that enables cross-platform code transformations.

#### Plugin Types

Kotlin supports several types of compiler plugins, each serving different purposes. Annotation processors generate code based on annotations, while bytecode transformers modify compiled classes. Language feature plugins add new syntax or semantics, and code generators create additional source files or resources.

Some plugins operate purely at compile time, removing their traces from the final output, while others embed runtime components that work alongside the generated code. The choice depends on the plugin's purpose and the level of integration required.

### All-Open and No-Arg Plugins

These plugins solve common interoperability issues when using Kotlin with frameworks that expect specific class characteristics, particularly Java frameworks that rely on reflection or inheritance.

#### All-Open Plugin

The all-open plugin makes classes and their members open (non-final) based on annotations. This addresses the problem where Java frameworks expect classes to be extensible, but Kotlin classes are final by default.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
allOpen {
    annotation("com.example.Open")
    annotation("org.springframework.stereotype.Component")
    annotation("javax.persistence.Entity")
}

// Usage
@Entity
class User {
    // This class becomes open automatically
    var name: String = ""
    var email: String = ""
}
```

The plugin works by scanning for specified annotations and modifying the bytecode to remove the final modifier from annotated classes and their members. This transformation occurs during compilation, so the source code remains unchanged while the compiled bytecode meets framework requirements.

Spring Framework integration benefits significantly from this plugin. Entity classes, configuration classes, and component classes all need to be open for framework features like proxying and inheritance to work correctly.

```kotlin
// Spring configuration with all-open
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    fun dataSource(): DataSource {
        // Method becomes open automatically
        return HikariDataSource()
    }
}
```

#### No-Arg Plugin

The no-arg plugin generates parameterless constructors for classes marked with specific annotations. This solves compatibility issues with frameworks that instantiate classes through reflection and require default constructors.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
noArg {
    annotation("com.example.NoArg")
    annotation("javax.persistence.Entity")
    annotation("org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication")
}

// Usage
@Entity
class Product(val name: String, val price: Double) {
    // No-arg constructor generated automatically
    // Original constructor remains available
}
```

The generated constructor initializes properties with default values based on their types: null for nullable references, zero for numbers, false for booleans, and empty collections for collection types. This ensures the object is in a valid state even when created through reflection.

JPA entities particularly benefit from this plugin since the JPA specification requires entities to have default constructors. The plugin allows writing idiomatic Kotlin code with primary constructors while maintaining JPA compatibility.

```kotlin
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
class User(
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    val id: Long = 0,
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    val username: String = "",
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    val email: String = ""
)
```

#### Plugin Configuration

Both plugins support advanced configuration options for fine-tuning their behavior. You can specify multiple annotations, use annotation patterns, or configure plugin-specific settings.

```kotlin
allOpen {
    annotation("com.example.Open")
    annotation("org.springframework.stereotype.Component")
    annotation("javax.persistence.Entity")
    annotations("org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication")
}

noArg {
    annotation("javax.persistence.Entity")
    annotation("org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Document")
    invokeInitializers = true // Call property initializers
}
```

### Serialization Plugin

The Kotlin serialization plugin generates serialization code for data classes, enabling efficient and type-safe serialization without reflection or runtime overhead.

#### Plugin Integration

The serialization plugin integrates with the kotlinx.serialization library to provide compile-time code generation for serializable classes. The plugin analyzes class structure and generates optimized serialization logic.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    kotlin("plugin.serialization")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.6.0")
}
```

#### Serializable Classes

Classes marked with `@Serializable` annotation are processed by the plugin, which generates companion object extensions and serialization descriptors. The plugin handles various data types, including primitives, collections, and custom classes.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class User(
    val id: Long,
    val name: String,
    val email: String?,
    val createdAt: Instant
)

@Serializable
data class Project(
    val name: String,
    val owner: User,
    val contributors: List<User> = emptyList()
)
```

The plugin generates serializers automatically, handling type information, nullability, and default values. Generated code is optimized for performance and produces minimal bytecode overhead.

#### Custom Serializers

The plugin supports custom serializers for types that need special handling. You can create serializers for third-party classes or implement custom serialization logic for specific requirements.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class Config(
    val host: String,
    @Serializable(with = UrlSerializer::class)
    val url: URL,
    @Serializable(with = LocalDateTimeSerializer::class)
    val timestamp: LocalDateTime
)

object UrlSerializer : KSerializer<URL> {
    override val descriptor = PrimitiveSerialDescriptor("URL", PrimitiveKind.STRING)
    
    override fun serialize(encoder: Encoder, value: URL) {
        encoder.encodeString(value.toString())
    }
    
    override fun deserialize(decoder: Decoder): URL {
        return URL(decoder.decodeString())
    }
}
```

#### Serialization Formats

The plugin works with multiple serialization formats through format-specific libraries. JSON is the most common format, but the plugin also supports Protocol Buffers, CBOR, and custom formats.

```kotlin
// JSON serialization
val json = Json {
    ignoreUnknownKeys = true
    prettyPrint = true
}

val user = User(1, "John", "john@example.com", Instant.now())
val jsonString = json.encodeToString(user)
val deserializedUser = json.decodeFromString<User>(jsonString)

// Protocol Buffers
val protobuf = ProtoBuf
val bytes = protobuf.encodeToByteArray(user)
val deserializedUser = protobuf.decodeFromByteArray<User>(bytes)
```

#### Advanced Features

The serialization plugin supports advanced features like polymorphic serialization, contextual serialization, and custom naming strategies. These features enable handling complex object hierarchies and adapting to different serialization requirements.

```kotlin
@Serializable
sealed class Message {
    @Serializable
    @SerialName("text")
    data class Text(val content: String) : Message()
    
    @Serializable
    @SerialName("image")
    data class Image(val url: String, val caption: String?) : Message()
}

@Serializable
data class Chat(
    val id: String,
    val messages: List<Message>
)
```

### Custom Compiler Plugins

Creating custom compiler plugins allows extending Kotlin's capabilities with domain-specific features, code generation, or compile-time validation.

#### Plugin Development Overview

Custom compiler plugins require deep understanding of the Kotlin compiler internals and the AST structure. Plugin development involves implementing specific interfaces and registering transformations that modify the compilation process.

The plugin API provides access to various compiler phases, allowing plugins to analyze code structure, validate custom annotations, generate additional code, or modify existing declarations. Plugins can target specific platforms or work across all Kotlin targets.

```kotlin
// Basic plugin structure
class MyCompilerPlugin : ComponentRegistrar {
    override fun registerProjectComponents(
        project: MockProject,
        configuration: CompilerConfiguration
    ) {
        SyntheticResolveExtension.registerExtension(
            project,
            MyResolveExtension()
        )
    }
}
```

#### Plugin Components

Compiler plugins consist of several components that handle different aspects of the compilation process. Extension registrars initialize plugin components, while actual extensions implement the transformation logic.

Resolve extensions handle synthetic declaration generation, allowing plugins to add methods, properties, or classes that don't exist in source code. Code generation extensions create additional source files or modify existing ones during compilation.

```kotlin
class MyResolveExtension : SyntheticResolveExtension {
    override fun generateSyntheticMethods(
        thisDescriptor: ClassDescriptor,
        name: Name,
        bindingContext: BindingContext,
        fromSupertypes: List<PropertyDescriptor>,
        result: MutableCollection<PropertyDescriptor>
    ) {
        // Generate synthetic methods based on class analysis
    }
}
```

#### Code Generation

Custom plugins can generate code at various levels: source code generation, AST modification, or bytecode transformation. The choice depends on the plugin's requirements and the target platform.

Source code generation creates additional Kotlin files that are compiled alongside the original source. AST modification changes the parsed representation before code generation, while bytecode transformation modifies the final compiled output.

```kotlin
class CodeGeneratorExtension : FirExtensionRegistrar() {
    override fun ExtensionRegistrarContext.configurePlugin() {
        +::MyFirExtension
    }
}

class MyFirExtension(session: FirSession) : FirExtension(session) {
    override fun getStatusTransformerForClass(
        declaration: FirRegularClass,
        context: FirDeclarationStatusResolveContext
    ): FirStatusTransformer? {
        // Modify class status based on custom logic
        return null
    }
}
```

#### Plugin Testing

Testing custom compiler plugins requires setting up compilation environments and verifying the generated code or transformations. The Kotlin compiler provides testing utilities for plugin development.

```kotlin
@Test
fun testPluginBehavior() {
    val result = compile(
        sourceFile = SourceFile.kotlin(
            "Test.kt",
            """
            @MyAnnotation
            class TestClass {
                fun originalMethod() {}
            }
            """
        )
    )
    
    assertEquals(KotlinCompilation.ExitCode.OK, result.exitCode)
    
    // Verify generated code
    val generatedClass = result.classLoader.loadClass("TestClass")
    assertTrue(generatedClass.methods.any { it.name == "generatedMethod" })
}
```

#### Plugin Distribution

Custom compiler plugins can be distributed as Gradle plugins, providing easy integration into build systems. The plugin distribution includes the compiler plugin itself and any necessary runtime dependencies.

```kotlin
// Plugin build configuration
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm")
    `java-gradle-plugin`
    `maven-publish`
}

gradlePlugin {
    plugins {
        create("myPlugin") {
            id = "com.example.my-plugin"
            implementationClass = "com.example.MyGradlePlugin"
        }
    }
}
```

**Key points**: Compiler plugins extend Kotlin's compilation process through AST transformation and code generation. All-open and no-arg plugins solve framework interoperability issues by modifying class characteristics. The serialization plugin generates efficient serialization code without runtime reflection. Custom plugins require deep compiler knowledge but enable powerful domain-specific language extensions and code generation capabilities.

## Android Development with Kotlin

### Android App Architecture

Modern Android application architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability through well-defined layers and patterns. The recommended architecture follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern combined with Repository pattern and Clean Architecture principles to create scalable, robust applications.

The presentation layer consists of UI components (Activities, Fragments, Composables) that observe and react to state changes. These components should be thin, containing minimal logic and delegating business operations to ViewModels. The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the UI and business logic, managing UI-related data and surviving configuration changes.

```kotlin
class UserProfileViewModel(
    private val userRepository: UserRepository,
    private val savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle
) : ViewModel() {
    
    private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(UserProfileUiState())
    val uiState: StateFlow<UserProfileUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()
    
    private val userId: String = savedStateHandle.get<String>("userId") ?: ""
    
    init {
        loadUserProfile()
    }
    
    private fun loadUserProfile() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(isLoading = true)
            try {
                val user = userRepository.getUserById(userId)
                _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(
                    user = user,
                    isLoading = false
                )
            } catch (exception: Exception) {
                _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(
                    error = exception.message,
                    isLoading = false
                )
            }
        }
    }
}

data class UserProfileUiState(
    val user: User? = null,
    val isLoading: Boolean = false,
    val error: String? = null
)
```

The domain layer contains business logic and use cases that are independent of Android framework components. Use cases encapsulate specific business operations and coordinate between different repositories. This layer should be pure Kotlin without Android dependencies, enabling easy testing and potential code sharing between platforms.

The data layer manages data sources and provides a clean API to the domain layer through repositories. Repositories abstract the complexity of data access, coordinating between local databases, remote APIs, and caching mechanisms. This layer handles data transformation, caching strategies, and offline capabilities.

**Key points** for Android architecture include implementing proper error handling strategies that provide meaningful feedback to users while maintaining application stability. The architecture should support offline-first approaches where applicable, using local databases as the single source of truth and synchronizing with remote services when connectivity is available.

State management across the application requires careful consideration of data flow and state ownership. Unidirectional data flow ensures predictable state changes and easier debugging. State should be hoisted to the appropriate level in the component hierarchy to enable sharing between components while maintaining encapsulation.

### Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose represents a paradigm shift in Android UI development, embracing declarative programming principles where UI is described as a function of state rather than imperatively manipulated through view references. This approach leads to more predictable, testable, and maintainable user interfaces.

Composable functions are the building blocks of Compose UI, annotated with `@Composable` and designed to be pure functions that transform data into UI elements. These functions can be combined and reused to build complex interfaces from simple components. The Compose runtime tracks state changes and recomposes only the parts of the UI that need updating.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun UserProfileScreen(
    uiState: UserProfileUiState,
    onRefresh: () -> Unit,
    onNavigateBack: () -> Unit
) {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(16.dp)
    ) {
        TopAppBar(
            title = { Text("User Profile") },
            navigationIcon = {
                IconButton(onClick = onNavigateBack) {
                    Icon(Icons.Default.ArrowBack, contentDescription = "Back")
                }
            }
        )
        
        when {
            uiState.isLoading -> {
                Box(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
                ) {
                    CircularProgressIndicator()
                }
            }
            
            uiState.error != null -> {
                ErrorMessage(
                    message = uiState.error,
                    onRetry = onRefresh
                )
            }
            
            uiState.user != null -> {
                UserProfileContent(user = uiState.user)
            }
        }
    }
}

@Composable
fun UserProfileContent(user: User) {
    LazyColumn {
        item {
            AsyncImage(
                model = user.profileImageUrl,
                contentDescription = "Profile Image",
                modifier = Modifier
                    .size(120.dp)
                    .clip(CircleShape)
            )
        }
        
        item {
            Text(
                text = user.displayName,
                style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium
            )
        }
        
        item {
            Text(
                text = user.email,
                style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium
            )
        }
    }
}
```

State management in Compose revolves around the concepts of state hoisting and composition local. State should be owned by the lowest common ancestor of all components that need to read or modify it. The `remember` and `mutableStateOf` functions create state that survives recomposition, while `rememberSaveable` survives process death.

Side effects in Compose are handled through specialized functions like `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, and `SideEffect`. These functions ensure that side effects are properly managed during the composition lifecycle, preventing memory leaks and ensuring correct cleanup.

**Key points** for Compose development include understanding that recomposition can happen frequently and at any time, so composable functions should be idempotent and side-effect free. Performance optimization involves minimizing recomposition scope through stable types and proper use of keys in lists.

Custom composables should follow composition over inheritance principles, accepting modifier parameters and providing sensible defaults. The modifier system enables flexible styling and behavior customization while maintaining component reusability.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CustomButton(
    text: String,
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    colors: ButtonColors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors()
) {
    Button(
        onClick = onClick,
        modifier = modifier,
        enabled = enabled,
        colors = colors
    ) {
        Text(text = text)
    }
}
```

### Android-Specific Kotlin Features

Kotlin provides several Android-specific features and optimizations that enhance development productivity and application performance. These features integrate deeply with Android's architecture and lifecycle management, providing more idiomatic ways to handle common Android development patterns.

Android Extensions, while deprecated, were replaced by View Binding and Data Binding, which provide type-safe access to views without findViewById calls. View Binding generates binding classes for each XML layout, providing direct references to views with null safety and type safety guarantees.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        
        binding.submitButton.setOnClickListener {
            handleSubmit()
        }
    }
    
    private fun handleSubmit() {
        val userInput = binding.userInputEditText.text.toString()
        // Process user input
    }
}
```

Kotlin Coroutines integration with Android provides powerful asynchronous programming capabilities that work seamlessly with Android's lifecycle. The `viewModelScope` and `lifecycleScope` ensure coroutines are automatically cancelled when their associated lifecycle ends, preventing memory leaks and unnecessary work.

**Key points** for Android-specific Kotlin features include understanding that extension functions can add Android-specific functionality to existing classes. Common patterns include adding lifecycle-aware extensions to Fragment and Activity classes, or creating extension functions for common Android operations.

```kotlin
// Extension function for showing toast messages
fun Context.showToast(message: String, duration: Int = Toast.LENGTH_SHORT) {
    Toast.makeText(this, message, duration).show()
}

// Extension function for hiding keyboard
fun Activity.hideKeyboard() {
    val inputMethodManager = getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE) as InputMethodManager
    currentFocus?.let { view ->
        inputMethodManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.windowToken, 0)
    }
}

// Lifecycle-aware extension for Fragment
fun Fragment.collectLatestLifecycleFlow(
    flow: Flow<Any>,
    collect: suspend (value: Any) -> Unit
) {
    viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
        viewLifecycleOwner.repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
            flow.collectLatest(collect)
        }
    }
}
```

Parcelize annotation simplifies the implementation of Parcelable interface, which is essential for passing complex objects between Android components. This annotation automatically generates the necessary Parcelable implementation code, reducing boilerplate and potential errors.

```kotlin
@Parcelize
data class User(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val email: String,
    val profileImageUrl: String?
) : Parcelable
```

### Dependency Injection with Hilt

Hilt provides a standardized way to implement dependency injection in Android applications, built on top of Dagger and designed specifically for Android's component lifecycle. It reduces boilerplate code while providing compile-time safety and performance benefits through code generation.

Hilt's architecture revolves around predefined component scopes that align with Android's component lifecycle. The `@HiltAndroidApp` annotation on the Application class triggers Hilt's code generation, creating the necessary dependency injection infrastructure. Each Android component (Activity, Fragment, Service, etc.) can be injected with dependencies by using the appropriate Hilt annotation.

```kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class MyApplication : Application()

@AndroidEntryPoint
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    
    @Inject
    lateinit var userRepository: UserRepository
    
    @Inject
    lateinit var analyticsService: AnalyticsService
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // Dependencies are automatically injected
        userRepository.getCurrentUser()
    }
}
```

Module classes define how dependencies are provided and configured. Hilt modules are annotated with `@Module` and `@InstallIn` to specify which component the module should be installed in. The `@Provides` annotation marks methods that provide dependencies, while `@Binds` annotation is used for binding interfaces to implementations.

```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object DatabaseModule {
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideDatabase(@ApplicationContext context: Context): AppDatabase {
        return Room.databaseBuilder(
            context,
            AppDatabase::class.java,
            "app_database"
        ).build()
    }
    
    @Provides
    fun provideUserDao(database: AppDatabase): UserDao {
        return database.userDao()
    }
}

@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
abstract class RepositoryModule {
    
    @Binds
    abstract fun bindUserRepository(
        userRepositoryImpl: UserRepositoryImpl
    ): UserRepository
}
```

**Key points** for Hilt implementation include understanding the component hierarchy and scope management. Dependencies injected at higher levels (like SingletonComponent) are available throughout the application lifecycle, while component-specific dependencies (like ActivityComponent) are recreated with their associated component.

Hilt's integration with ViewModels simplifies ViewModel creation and dependency injection. The `@HiltViewModel` annotation enables automatic ViewModel creation with injected dependencies, eliminating the need for custom ViewModel factories.

```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class UserProfileViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val userRepository: UserRepository,
    private val savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle
) : ViewModel() {
    
    private val userId: String = savedStateHandle.get<String>("userId") ?: ""
    
    private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(UserProfileUiState())
    val uiState: StateFlow<UserProfileUiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()
    
    init {
        loadUserProfile()
    }
    
    private fun loadUserProfile() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            try {
                val user = userRepository.getUserById(userId)
                _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(user = user)
            } catch (exception: Exception) {
                _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(error = exception.message)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Testing with Hilt requires understanding how to replace dependencies with test implementations. Hilt provides testing utilities that allow replacing modules or individual dependencies for testing purposes. The `@UninstallModules` annotation removes production modules, while test modules provide test-specific implementations.

```kotlin
@UninstallModules(DatabaseModule::class)
@HiltAndroidTest
class UserProfileViewModelTest {
    
    @get:Rule
    var hiltRule = HiltAndroidRule(this)
    
    @Inject
    lateinit var userRepository: UserRepository
    
    @Before
    fun setUp() {
        hiltRule.inject()
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `loadUserProfile should update UI state with user data`() = runTest {
        // Test implementation
    }
}

@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object TestDatabaseModule {
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideTestDatabase(@ApplicationContext context: Context): AppDatabase {
        return Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder(
            context,
            AppDatabase::class.java
        ).allowMainThreadQueries().build()
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**

Android development with Kotlin leverages the language's powerful features to create robust, maintainable applications. Modern Android architecture emphasizes separation of concerns through well-defined layers and unidirectional data flow. Jetpack Compose transforms UI development with declarative programming principles, enabling more predictable and testable interfaces. Android-specific Kotlin features provide idiomatic solutions for common development patterns, while Hilt simplifies dependency injection with compile-time safety and lifecycle-aware components. Together, these technologies enable developers to build high-quality Android applications that are both performant and maintainable.

## Backend Development

### Ktor Framework

Ktor is a lightweight, asynchronous framework built specifically for Kotlin that emphasizes coroutines and functional programming. It provides both server and client capabilities with a modular architecture where features are installed as needed. The framework supports multiple engines including Netty, Jetty, and Tomcat, allowing deployment flexibility.

Routing in Ktor uses a DSL approach where routes are defined hierarchically. The routing system supports HTTP methods, path parameters, query parameters, and nested routes. Content negotiation handles serialization and deserialization automatically, supporting JSON, XML, and custom formats through plugins.

Authentication and authorization are handled through installable features supporting various schemes including Basic, Digest, JWT, and OAuth. Session management provides stateful interactions with configurable storage backends. The framework includes built-in support for CORS, compression, caching, and logging.

Ktor's plugin system allows extending functionality through features like database integration, metrics collection, and custom middleware. The framework's coroutine-based nature enables high-concurrency applications with efficient resource utilization. Testing support includes dedicated test engines and utilities for comprehensive API testing.

### Spring Boot with Kotlin

Spring Boot provides excellent Kotlin support through dedicated annotations and extensions that make Java interoperability seamless. The framework leverages Kotlin's null safety features and provides nullable variants of common Spring annotations. Dependency injection works naturally with Kotlin's constructor-based dependency injection patterns.

Configuration classes use Kotlin's concise syntax with data classes and extension functions. The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation works seamlessly with Kotlin data classes, providing type-safe configuration binding. Spring Boot's auto-configuration adapts to Kotlin's conventions, reducing boilerplate code significantly.

Web development with Spring WebFlux supports reactive programming using Kotlin coroutines. The framework provides coroutine-based alternatives to reactive streams, making asynchronous code more readable. Router functions can be defined using Kotlin DSL, creating clean and expressive routing configurations.

Spring Boot's testing framework integrates well with Kotlin's testing libraries. The `@SpringBootTest` annotation works with Kotlin test classes, and MockK provides Kotlin-native mocking capabilities. WebTestClient supports coroutine-based testing for reactive endpoints.

### Database Access with Exposed

Exposed is a lightweight SQL library for Kotlin that provides both DSL and DAO approaches to database access. The DSL approach offers type-safe SQL query construction with compile-time verification. The DAO approach provides object-relational mapping with lazy loading and relationship management.

Table definitions use Kotlin object declarations with strongly-typed column definitions. The library supports various column types including custom types and JSON columns. Relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys and reference columns with automatic join generation.

Transaction management in Exposed uses a functional approach where database operations are wrapped in transaction blocks. The library provides connection pooling and supports multiple database engines including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and H2. Migration support enables schema evolution through version-controlled database changes.

Query composition allows building complex queries programmatically with type safety. The library supports aggregate functions, subqueries, and complex joins while maintaining SQL-like syntax. Batch operations optimize performance for bulk data manipulation.

### API Design and Implementation

REST API design in Kotlin backend frameworks follows established principles with language-specific enhancements. Resource modeling uses data classes with proper serialization annotations. URL structure follows RESTful conventions with proper HTTP method usage and status code handling.

Request validation leverages Kotlin's type system and validation libraries. Bean validation annotations work with Kotlin properties, while custom validators can be implemented using Kotlin's concise syntax. Error handling uses sealed classes or exception hierarchies to provide structured error responses.

API versioning strategies include URL path versioning, header-based versioning, and content negotiation. Documentation generation uses tools like OpenAPI with Kotlin-specific generators. The documentation can be generated automatically from code annotations and type information.

Security implementation includes authentication filters, authorization checks, and input sanitization. JWT token handling uses Kotlin-specific libraries that provide type-safe token manipulation. Rate limiting and throttling protect against abuse while maintaining good performance.

Asynchronous processing uses coroutines for non-blocking operations. Background job processing integrates with frameworks like Quartz or custom coroutine-based schedulers. Event-driven architectures leverage Kotlin's functional programming features for clean event handling.

**Key points:**

- Ktor provides lightweight, coroutine-based server development with modular architecture
- Spring Boot offers comprehensive enterprise features with excellent Kotlin integration
- Exposed delivers type-safe database access with both DSL and DAO approaches
- API design benefits from Kotlin's type system and null safety features
- Coroutines enable efficient asynchronous processing in all frameworks
- Testing support is comprehensive across all major Kotlin backend frameworks

**Example:**

```kotlin
// Ktor API implementation
fun Application.configureRouting() {
    routing {
        route("/api/users") {
            get {
                val users = userService.getAllUsers()
                call.respond(users)
            }
            
            post {
                val user = call.receive<CreateUserRequest>()
                val createdUser = userService.createUser(user)
                call.respond(HttpStatusCode.Created, createdUser)
            }
            
            get("/{id}") {
                val id = call.parameters["id"]?.toIntOrNull()
                    ?: throw BadRequestException("Invalid user ID")
                val user = userService.getUserById(id)
                    ?: throw NotFoundException("User not found")
                call.respond(user)
            }
        }
    }
}

// Exposed database access
object Users : Table() {
    val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
    val name = varchar("name", 50)
    val email = varchar("email", 100)
    val createdAt = datetime("created_at")
    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
}

class UserService {
    suspend fun getAllUsers(): List<User> = dbQuery {
        Users.selectAll().map { 
            User(
                id = it[Users.id],
                name = it[Users.name],
                email = it[Users.email],
                createdAt = it[Users.createdAt]
            )
        }
    }
    
    suspend fun createUser(request: CreateUserRequest): User = dbQuery {
        val insertedId = Users.insert {
            it[name] = request.name
            it[email] = request.email
            it[createdAt] = LocalDateTime.now()
        }[Users.id]
        
        getUserById(insertedId)!!
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:** Kotlin backend development offers multiple robust frameworks each with distinct advantages. Ktor excels in lightweight, coroutine-based applications, while Spring Boot provides comprehensive enterprise features. Exposed delivers type-safe database access, and proper API design leverages Kotlin's strengths for maintainable, scalable backend systems.

class UserRepository(private val api: UserApi) {
    suspend fun getUser(id: String): User? {
        return try {
            api.fetchUser(id)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            null
        }
    }
    
    suspend fun saveUser(user: User): Boolean {

        return try {
            val user = repository.getUser(id)
            if (user != null) {
                Result.success(user)
            } else {
                Result.failure(Exception("User not found"))
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Result.failure(e)
        }
    }
}
```

### Sharing Code Between Platforms

#### Common Code Organization

```kotlin
// Domain layer - Pure business logic
// commonMain/domain/
interface UserRepository {
    suspend fun getUser(id: String): User?
    suspend fun saveUser(user: User): Boolean
}

class UserInteractor(
    private val repository: UserRepository,
    private val validator: UserValidator
) {
    suspend fun updateUser(user: User): UserUpdateResult {
        return when (val validation = validator.validate(user)) {
            is ValidationResult.Valid -> {
                val success = repository.saveUser(user)
                if (success) UserUpdateResult.Success else UserUpdateResult.Error
            }
            is ValidationResult.Invalid -> UserUpdateResult.ValidationError(validation.errors)
        }
    }
}

// Validation logic
class UserValidator {
    fun validate(user: User): ValidationResult {
        val errors = mutableListOf<String>()
        
        if (user.name.isBlank()) {
            errors.add("Name cannot be empty")
        }
        
        if (!user.email.contains("@")) {
            errors.add("Invalid email format")
        }
        
        return if (errors.isEmpty()) {
            ValidationResult.Valid
        } else {
            ValidationResult.Invalid(errors)
        }
    }
}

sealed class ValidationResult {
    object Valid : ValidationResult()
    data class Invalid(val errors: List<String>) : ValidationResult()
}

sealed class UserUpdateResult {
    object Success : UserUpdateResult()
    object Error : UserUpdateResult()
    data class ValidationError(val errors: List<String>) : UserUpdateResult()
}
```

#### Network Layer Sharing

```kotlin
// Common HTTP client
class ApiClient {
    private val client = HttpClient {
        install(ContentNegotiation) {
            json(Json {
                prettyPrint = true
                isLenient = true
                ignoreUnknownKeys = true
            })
        }
    }
    
    suspend fun get(url: String): String {
        return client.get(url).body()
    }
    
    suspend inline fun <reified T> getJson(url: String): T {
        return client.get(url).body()
    }
    
    suspend inline fun <reified T> postJson(url: String, data: T): String {
        return client.post(url) {
            contentType(ContentType.Application.Json)
            setBody(data)
        }.body()
    }
}

// Shared API service
class UserApiService(private val client: ApiClient) {
    suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User {
        return client.getJson("https://api.example.com/users/$id")
    }
    
    suspend fun updateUser(user: User): User {
        return client.postJson("https://api.example.com/users/${user.id}", user)
    }
}
```

#### Database Abstraction

```kotlin
// Common database interface
interface UserDatabase {
    suspend fun insertUser(user: User)
    suspend fun getUserById(id: String): User?
    suspend fun getAllUsers(): List<User>
    suspend fun deleteUser(id: String)
}

// Repository implementation using database
class UserRepositoryImpl(
    private val database: UserDatabase,
    private val apiService: UserApiService
) : UserRepository {
    
    override suspend fun getUser(id: String): User? {
        // Try local first
        val localUser = database.getUserById(id)
        if (localUser != null) return localUser
        
        // Fetch from API
        return try {
            val remoteUser = apiService.fetchUser(id)
            database.insertUser(remoteUser)
            remoteUser
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            null
        }
    }
    
    override suspend fun saveUser(user: User): Boolean {
        return try {
            apiService.updateUser(user)
            database.insertUser(user)
            true
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            false
        }
    }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Implementations

#### Expect/Actual Mechanism

```kotlin
// commonMain - Declaration
expect class PlatformContext

expect fun getPlatformName(): String

expect class Logger {
    fun log(message: String)
    fun error(message: String, throwable: Throwable?)
}

expect class ImageLoader {
    suspend fun loadImage(url: String): PlatformImage
}

expect class PlatformImage
```

```kotlin
// androidMain - Android implementation
actual typealias PlatformContext = Context

actual fun getPlatformName(): String = "Android"

actual class Logger {
    actual fun log(message: String) {
        Log.d("KMM", message)
    }
    
    actual fun error(message: String, throwable: Throwable?) {
        Log.e("KMM", message, throwable)
    }
}

actual class ImageLoader {
    actual suspend fun loadImage(url: String): PlatformImage {
        // Use Coil or Glide for Android
        return PlatformImage(url)
    }
}

actual class PlatformImage(val url: String)
```

```kotlin
// iosMain - iOS implementation
import platform.UIKit.UIImage
import platform.Foundation.NSLog

actual typealias PlatformContext = Any

actual fun getPlatformName(): String = "iOS"

actual class Logger {
    actual fun log(message: String) {
        NSLog("KMM: $message")
    }
    
    actual fun error(message: String, throwable: Throwable?) {
        NSLog("KMM ERROR: $message - ${throwable?.message}")
    }
}

actual class ImageLoader {
    actual suspend fun loadImage(url: String): PlatformImage {
        // Use native iOS image loading
        return PlatformImage()
    }
}

actual class PlatformImage
```

#### Platform-Specific Dependencies

```kotlin
// Storage abstraction
expect class SecureStorage {
    suspend fun store(key: String, value: String)
    suspend fun retrieve(key: String): String?
    suspend fun delete(key: String)
}

// Android implementation
actual class SecureStorage(private val context: Context) {
    private val sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences(
        "secure_prefs", 
        Context.MODE_PRIVATE
    )
    
    actual suspend fun store(key: String, value: String) {
        withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            sharedPreferences.edit().putString(key, value).apply()
        }
    }
    
    actual suspend fun retrieve(key: String): String? {
        return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            sharedPreferences.getString(key, null)
        }
    }
    
    actual suspend fun delete(key: String) {
        withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            sharedPreferences.edit().remove(key).apply()
        }
    }
}

// iOS implementation
actual class SecureStorage {
    actual suspend fun store(key: String, value: String) {
        // Use iOS Keychain
        KeychainHelper.store(key, value)
    }
    
    actual suspend fun retrieve(key: String): String? {
        return KeychainHelper.retrieve(key)
    }
    
    actual suspend fun delete(key: String) {
        KeychainHelper.delete(key)
    }
}
```

#### Platform-Specific UI Integration

```kotlin
// Shared ViewModel-like class
class UserViewModel(
    private val getUserUseCase: GetUserUseCase,
    private val logger: Logger
) {
    private val _userState = MutableStateFlow<UserState>(UserState.Loading)
    val userState = _userState.asStateFlow()
    
    fun loadUser(id: String) {
        CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
            _userState.value = UserState.Loading
            
            try {
                val result = getUserUseCase(id)
                _userState.value = when {
                    result.isSuccess -> UserState.Success(result.getOrNull()!!)
                    else -> UserState.Error(result.exceptionOrNull()?.message ?: "Unknown error")
                }
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                logger.error("Failed to load user", e)
                _userState.value = UserState.Error(e.message ?: "Unknown error")
            }
        }
    }
}

sealed class UserState {
    object Loading : UserState()
    data class Success(val user: User) : UserState()
    data class Error(val message: String) : UserState()
}
```

### Multiplatform Architecture Patterns

#### Clean Architecture with KMM

```kotlin
// Domain layer (Pure Kotlin)
// entities/User.kt
data class User(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val email: String
)

// repositories/UserRepository.kt
interface UserRepository {
    suspend fun getUser(id: String): Result<User>
    suspend fun saveUser(user: User): Result<Unit>
}

// usecases/GetUserUseCase.kt
class GetUserUseCase(private val repository: UserRepository) {
    suspend operator fun invoke(id: String): Result<User> {
        return repository.getUser(id)
    }
}

// Data layer
// datasources/UserDataSource.kt
interface UserDataSource {
    suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User
    suspend fun saveUser(user: User)
}

// repositories/UserRepositoryImpl.kt
class UserRepositoryImpl(
    private val remoteDataSource: UserDataSource,
    private val localDataSource: UserDataSource
) : UserRepository {
    
    override suspend fun getUser(id: String): Result<User> {
        return try {
            // Try local first
            val localUser = runCatching { localDataSource.fetchUser(id) }
            if (localUser.isSuccess) {
                return localUser
            }
            
            // Fetch from remote
            val remoteUser = remoteDataSource.fetchUser(id)
            localDataSource.saveUser(remoteUser)
            Result.success(remoteUser)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Result.failure(e)
        }
    }
    
    override suspend fun saveUser(user: User): Result<Unit> {
        return try {
            remoteDataSource.saveUser(user)
            localDataSource.saveUser(user)
            Result.success(Unit)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Result.failure(e)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dependency Injection Pattern

```kotlin
// DI container
class DIContainer {
    // Platform-specific dependencies
    private val logger: Logger by lazy { Logger() }
    private val secureStorage: SecureStorage by lazy { SecureStorage() }
    
    // Network dependencies
    private val apiClient: ApiClient by lazy { ApiClient() }
    private val userApiService: UserApiService by lazy { UserApiService(apiClient) }
    
    // Data sources
    private val remoteUserDataSource: UserDataSource by lazy { 
        RemoteUserDataSource(userApiService) 
    }
    private val localUserDataSource: UserDataSource by lazy { 
        LocalUserDataSource(secureStorage) 
    }
    
    // Repository
    private val userRepository: UserRepository by lazy {
        UserRepositoryImpl(remoteUserDataSource, localUserDataSource)
    }
    
    // Use cases
    val getUserUseCase: GetUserUseCase by lazy { GetUserUseCase(userRepository) }
    val saveUserUseCase: SaveUserUseCase by lazy { SaveUserUseCase(userRepository) }
    
    // ViewModels
    fun createUserViewModel(): UserViewModel {
        return UserViewModel(getUserUseCase, saveUserUseCase, logger)
    }
}

// Platform-specific initialization
// Android
class AndroidDIContainer(context: Context) : DIContainer() {
    override val secureStorage: SecureStorage = SecureStorage(context)
}

// iOS
class IosDIContainer : DIContainer() {
    override val secureStorage: SecureStorage = SecureStorage()
}
```

#### State Management Pattern

```kotlin
// Shared state management
class AppState {
    private val _authState = MutableStateFlow<AuthState>(AuthState.Unauthenticated)
    val authState = _authState.asStateFlow()
    
    private val _userState = MutableStateFlow<UserState>(UserState.Loading)
    val userState = _userState.asStateFlow()
    
    fun updateAuthState(newState: AuthState) {
        _authState.value = newState
    }
    
    fun updateUserState(newState: UserState) {
        _userState.value = newState
    }
}

sealed class AuthState {
    object Unauthenticated : AuthState()
    data class Authenticated(val token: String) : AuthState()
    object Loading : AuthState()
}

// State manager
class StateManager(
    private val appState: AppState,
    private val authUseCase: AuthUseCase,
    private val getUserUseCase: GetUserUseCase
) {
    
    suspend fun login(email: String, password: String) {
        appState.updateAuthState(AuthState.Loading)
        
        val result = authUseCase.login(email, password)
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            val token = result.getOrNull()!!
            appState.updateAuthState(AuthState.Authenticated(token))
            loadCurrentUser()
        } else {
            appState.updateAuthState(AuthState.Unauthenticated)
        }
    }
    
    private suspend fun loadCurrentUser() {
        appState.updateUserState(UserState.Loading)
        
        val result = getUserUseCase.getCurrentUser()
        appState.updateUserState(
            if (result.isSuccess) {
                UserState.Success(result.getOrNull()!!)
            } else {
                UserState.Error(result.exceptionOrNull()?.message ?: "Failed to load user")
            }
        )
    }
}
```

#### Platform Integration Pattern

```kotlin
// Platform bridge
class PlatformBridge {
    fun shareText(text: String) {
        shareTextImpl(text)
    }
    
    fun openUrl(url: String) {
        openUrlImpl(url)
    }
    
    fun showNotification(title: String, message: String) {
        showNotificationImpl(title, message)
    }
}

// Expected platform implementations
expect fun shareTextImpl(text: String)
expect fun openUrlImpl(url: String)
expect fun showNotificationImpl(title: String, message: String)

// Android implementation
actual fun shareTextImpl(text: String) {
    val intent = Intent().apply {
        action = Intent.ACTION_SEND
        putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, text)
        type = "text/plain"
    }
    // Start activity
}

actual fun openUrlImpl(url: String) {
    val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))
    // Start activity
}

actual fun showNotificationImpl(title: String, message: String) {
    // Use NotificationManager
}

// iOS implementation
actual fun shareTextImpl(text: String) {
    // Use UIActivityViewController
}

actual fun openUrlImpl(url: String) {
    // Use UIApplication.shared.open
}

actual fun showNotificationImpl(title: String, message: String) {
    // Use UNUserNotificationCenter
}
```

**Key points**:

- KMM enables sharing business logic while maintaining platform-specific UI and features
- Expect/actual mechanism provides platform-specific implementations with shared interfaces
- Clean architecture patterns work well with multiplatform development
- State management should be centralized in shared code
- Platform-specific features require careful abstraction design
- Dependency injection helps manage platform-specific dependencies

**Example** of a complete multiplatform feature:

```kotlin
// Complete feature implementation
class UserFeature(
    private val diContainer: DIContainer,
    private val platformBridge: PlatformBridge
) {
    private val viewModel = diContainer.createUserViewModel()
    
    suspend fun loadUser(id: String) {
        viewModel.loadUser(id)
    }
    
    fun shareUser(user: User) {
        platformBridge.shareText("Check out ${user.name}: ${user.email}")
    }
    
    fun openUserProfile(user: User) {
        platformBridge.openUrl("https://example.com/users/${user.id}")
    }
    
    fun observeUserState() = viewModel.userState
}
```

This architecture enables maximum code reuse while maintaining platform-specific capabilities and native performance characteristics.

# Capstone Project

## Project Planning and Implementation

### Choose a Substantial Project in Your Specialization

Selecting an appropriate project is crucial for demonstrating mastery of advanced Kotlin concepts while solving real-world problems. The project should be complex enough to showcase multiple language features and architectural patterns.

#### Project Selection Criteria

An ideal project incorporates multiple advanced Kotlin features including coroutines, advanced type systems, functional programming concepts, and platform-specific implementations. The project scope should be manageable within reasonable timeframes while providing opportunities to demonstrate expertise across different domains.

Consider projects that involve data processing, concurrent operations, network communication, or complex business logic. These domains naturally require advanced language features and provide clear opportunities for optimization and architectural decisions.

#### Example Project: Distributed Task Processing System

A distributed task processing system exemplifies the complexity needed to showcase advanced Kotlin capabilities. This project involves multiple components: task scheduling, worker management, result aggregation, and monitoring interfaces.

```kotlin
// Core domain model
@Serializable
sealed class Task {
    abstract val id: String
    abstract val priority: Priority
    abstract val createdAt: Instant
    
    @Serializable
    data class DataProcessingTask(
        override val id: String,
        override val priority: Priority,
        override val createdAt: Instant,
        val inputData: String,
        val processingConfig: ProcessingConfig
    ) : Task()
    
    @Serializable
    data class NetworkTask(
        override val id: String,
        override val priority: Priority,
        override val createdAt: Instant,
        val url: String,
        val headers: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()
    ) : Task()
}

enum class Priority(val value: Int) {
    LOW(1), MEDIUM(2), HIGH(3), CRITICAL(4)
}

@Serializable
data class TaskResult(
    val taskId: String,
    val status: TaskStatus,
    val result: String? = null,
    val error: String? = null,
    val processingTime: Duration,
    val completedAt: Instant
)
```

#### Alternative Project Options

Other substantial projects include building a reactive web framework, implementing a custom serialization library, creating a multiplatform networking client, or developing a domain-specific language compiler. Each option provides different learning opportunities and technical challenges.

A reactive web framework showcases coroutines, functional programming, and DSL creation. A serialization library demonstrates advanced type systems, reflection, and performance optimization. A multiplatform client highlights cross-platform development and expect/actual mechanisms.

### Apply All Learned Concepts

The implementation phase involves systematically applying advanced Kotlin concepts to solve project challenges, demonstrating mastery through practical application.

#### Advanced Type System Usage

Implement sophisticated type hierarchies using sealed classes, inline classes, and generic constraints. Leverage variance annotations and type projections to create flexible APIs while maintaining type safety.

```kotlin
// Advanced type system implementation
interface TaskProcessor<in T : Task, out R : TaskResult> {
    suspend fun process(task: T): R
}

class GenericTaskProcessor<T : Task> : TaskProcessor<T, TaskResult> {
    override suspend fun process(task: T): TaskResult = when (task) {
        is Task.DataProcessingTask -> processDataTask(task)
        is Task.NetworkTask -> processNetworkTask(task)
    }
    
    private suspend fun processDataTask(task: Task.DataProcessingTask): TaskResult {
        return withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {
            // Complex data processing logic
            val result = task.inputData.processWithConfig(task.processingConfig)
            TaskResult(
                taskId = task.id,
                status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED,
                result = result,
                processingTime = measureTime { /* processing */ },
                completedAt = Clock.System.now()
            )
        }
    }
}

// Type-safe builder pattern
class TaskBuilder<T : Task> {
    fun buildDataTask(block: DataTaskBuilder.() -> Unit): Task.DataProcessingTask {
        return DataTaskBuilder().apply(block).build()
    }
    
    fun buildNetworkTask(block: NetworkTaskBuilder.() -> Unit): Task.NetworkTask {
        return NetworkTaskBuilder().apply(block).build()
    }
}
```

#### Coroutines and Concurrency

Implement sophisticated concurrency patterns using channels, flows, and structured concurrency. Design actor-based systems for managing mutable state and implement backpressure handling for high-throughput scenarios.

```kotlin
// Advanced concurrency implementation
class TaskScheduler(
    private val workers: List<TaskWorker>,
    private val maxConcurrency: Int = 10
) {
    private val taskChannel = Channel<Task>(capacity = Channel.UNLIMITED)
    private val resultChannel = Channel<TaskResult>(capacity = Channel.UNLIMITED)
    private val semaphore = Semaphore(maxConcurrency)
    
    fun start() = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + SupervisorJob()).launch {
        // Worker management
        val workerJobs = workers.map { worker ->
            launch {
                worker.processTasksFrom(taskChannel, resultChannel, semaphore)
            }
        }
        
        // Result aggregation
        launch {
            aggregateResults()
        }
        
        // Cleanup on completion
        workerJobs.joinAll()
    }
    
    private suspend fun aggregateResults() {
        resultChannel.consumeAsFlow()
            .buffer(100)
            .collect { result ->
                when (result.status) {
                    TaskStatus.COMPLETED -> handleSuccess(result)
                    TaskStatus.FAILED -> handleError(result)
                    TaskStatus.CANCELLED -> handleCancellation(result)
                }
            }
    }
}

// Flow-based monitoring
class TaskMonitor {
    private val _metrics = MutableSharedFlow<TaskMetric>()
    val metrics: SharedFlow<TaskMetric> = _metrics.asSharedFlow()
    
    fun startMonitoring(): Flow<SystemHealth> = flow {
        while (currentCoroutineContext().isActive) {
            val health = calculateSystemHealth()
            emit(health)
            delay(5000) // Monitor every 5 seconds
        }
    }.flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)
}
```

#### Functional Programming Patterns

Apply functional programming principles including immutability, higher-order functions, and monadic patterns. Implement sophisticated data transformations and error handling using functional approaches.

```kotlin
// Functional programming implementation
sealed class Result<out T> {
    data class Success<T>(val value: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error(val exception: Throwable) : Result<Nothing>()
    
    inline fun <R> map(transform: (T) -> R): Result<R> = when (this) {
        is Success -> Success(transform(value))
        is Error -> this
    }
    
    inline fun <R> flatMap(transform: (T) -> Result<R>): Result<R> = when (this) {
        is Success -> transform(value)
        is Error -> this
    }
    
    inline fun onSuccess(action: (T) -> Unit): Result<T> = apply {
        if (this is Success) action(value)
    }
    
    inline fun onError(action: (Throwable) -> Unit): Result<T> = apply {
        if (this is Error) action(exception)
    }
}

// Functional composition
class TaskPipeline {
    private val transformations = mutableListOf<suspend (Task) -> Result<Task>>()
    
    fun addValidation(validator: suspend (Task) -> Boolean): TaskPipeline = apply {
        transformations.add { task ->
            if (validator(task)) Result.Success(task)
            else Result.Error(ValidationException("Task validation failed"))
        }
    }
    
    fun addTransformation(transform: suspend (Task) -> Task): TaskPipeline = apply {
        transformations.add { task ->
            try {
                Result.Success(transform(task))
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                Result.Error(e)
            }
        }
    }
    
    suspend fun process(task: Task): Result<Task> {
        return transformations.fold(Result.Success(task) as Result<Task>) { acc, transform ->
            acc.flatMap { transform(it) }
        }
    }
}
```

#### DSL Implementation

Create domain-specific languages for configuration, task definition, and system setup. Implement type-safe builders and leverage Kotlin's DSL capabilities for expressive APIs.

```kotlin
// DSL implementation
@DslMarker
annotation class TaskDsl

@TaskDsl
class TaskSchedulerConfig {
    var maxConcurrency: Int = 10
    var retryPolicy: RetryPolicy = RetryPolicy.DEFAULT
    var monitoringEnabled: Boolean = true
    
    private val workers = mutableListOf<WorkerConfig>()
    
    fun worker(block: WorkerConfig.() -> Unit) {
        workers.add(WorkerConfig().apply(block))
    }
    
    fun build(): TaskScheduler {
        return TaskScheduler(
            workers = workers.map { it.build() },
            maxConcurrency = maxConcurrency
        )
    }
}

@TaskDsl
class WorkerConfig {
    var name: String = ""
    var capacity: Int = 5
    var processorType: ProcessorType = ProcessorType.GENERIC
    
    fun build(): TaskWorker {
        return TaskWorker(name, capacity, processorType)
    }
}

// DSL usage
fun configureTaskScheduler(block: TaskSchedulerConfig.() -> Unit): TaskScheduler {
    return TaskSchedulerConfig().apply(block).build()
}

val scheduler = configureTaskScheduler {
    maxConcurrency = 20
    retryPolicy = RetryPolicy.EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF
    monitoringEnabled = true
    
    worker {
        name = "data-processor"
        capacity = 10
        processorType = ProcessorType.DATA_PROCESSING
    }
    
    worker {
        name = "network-worker"
        capacity = 15
        processorType = ProcessorType.NETWORK
    }
}
```

### Code Review and Refactoring

Systematic code review and refactoring ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. This process involves multiple iterations of analysis, improvement, and validation.

#### Code Review Process

Establish a comprehensive code review process that examines code structure, performance implications, error handling, and adherence to Kotlin idioms. Review sessions should focus on both technical correctness and architectural decisions.

```kotlin
// Before refactoring - problematic code
class TaskProcessor {
    fun processTasks(tasks: List<Task>): List<TaskResult> {
        val results = mutableListOf<TaskResult>()
        for (task in tasks) {
            try {
                val result = when (task) {
                    is Task.DataProcessingTask -> {
                        // Complex processing logic inline
                        val data = task.inputData.split(",")
                        val processed = data.map { it.trim().uppercase() }
                        TaskResult(task.id, TaskStatus.COMPLETED, processed.joinToString())
                    }
                    is Task.NetworkTask -> {
                        // Network call without proper error handling
                        val response = httpClient.get(task.url)
                        TaskResult(task.id, TaskStatus.COMPLETED, response.body)
                    }
                }
                results.add(result)
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                results.add(TaskResult(task.id, TaskStatus.FAILED, error = e.message))
            }
        }
        return results
    }
}
```

#### Refactoring Strategies

Apply systematic refactoring techniques including extracting functions, eliminating code duplication, improving error handling, and enhancing type safety. Focus on making code more expressive and maintainable.

```kotlin
// After refactoring - improved code
class TaskProcessor(
    private val dataProcessor: DataProcessor,
    private val networkClient: NetworkClient,
    private val errorHandler: ErrorHandler
) {
    suspend fun processTasks(tasks: List<Task>): List<TaskResult> = coroutineScope {
        tasks.map { task ->
            async {
                processTask(task)
            }
        }.awaitAll()
    }
    
    private suspend fun processTask(task: Task): TaskResult = try {
        when (task) {
            is Task.DataProcessingTask -> dataProcessor.process(task)
            is Task.NetworkTask -> networkClient.execute(task)
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        errorHandler.handleTaskError(task, e)
    }
}

class DataProcessor {
    suspend fun process(task: Task.DataProcessingTask): TaskResult = withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {
        val startTime = TimeSource.Monotonic.markNow()
        
        val result = task.inputData
            .split(",")
            .map { it.trim().uppercase() }
            .joinToString()
        
        TaskResult(
            taskId = task.id,
            status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED,
            result = result,
            processingTime = startTime.elapsedNow(),
            completedAt = Clock.System.now()
        )
    }
}
```

#### Performance Optimization

Identify and address performance bottlenecks through profiling, memory usage analysis, and algorithmic improvements. Focus on optimizing critical paths and reducing resource consumption.

```kotlin
// Performance-optimized implementation
class OptimizedTaskProcessor(
    private val processorPool: Pool<Processor>,
    private val resultCache: Cache<String, TaskResult>
) {
    suspend fun processTasksOptimized(tasks: List<Task>): List<TaskResult> {
        // Group tasks by type for batch processing
        val taskGroups = tasks.groupBy { it::class }
        
        return taskGroups.flatMap { (type, typedTasks) ->
            when (type) {
                Task.DataProcessingTask::class -> {
                    processDataTasksBatch(typedTasks.cast<Task.DataProcessingTask>())
                }
                Task.NetworkTask::class -> {
                    processNetworkTasksBatch(typedTasks.cast<Task.NetworkTask>())
                }
                else -> emptyList()
            }
        }
    }
    
    private suspend fun processDataTasksBatch(tasks: List<Task.DataProcessingTask>): List<TaskResult> {
        return tasks.chunked(100) { batch ->
            processorPool.use { processor ->
                processor.processBatch(batch)
            }
        }.flatten()
    }
}
```

### Documentation and Testing

Comprehensive documentation and testing strategies ensure code maintainability, facilitate team collaboration, and provide confidence in system reliability.

#### Documentation Strategy

Create multi-layered documentation including API documentation, architectural decision records, and user guides. Use KDoc for API documentation and maintain separate architectural documentation.

```kotlin
/**
 * A distributed task processing system that manages task execution across multiple workers.
 * 
 * This system provides:
 * - Concurrent task processing with configurable worker pools
 * - Fault tolerance through retry mechanisms and error handling
 * - Real-time monitoring and metrics collection
 * - Backpressure handling for high-throughput scenarios
 * 
 * ## Basic Usage
 * 
 * ```kotlin
 * val scheduler = configureTaskScheduler {
 *     maxConcurrency = 20
 *     worker {
 *         name = "data-processor"
 *         capacity = 10
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * scheduler.submitTask(dataProcessingTask)
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Architecture
 * 
 * The system consists of several key components:
 * - [TaskScheduler]: Manages task distribution and worker coordination
 * - [TaskWorker]: Executes individual tasks with type-specific processors
 * - [TaskMonitor]: Provides real-time system health and performance metrics
 * 
 * @param workers List of worker configurations for task processing
 * @param maxConcurrency Maximum number of concurrent tasks across all workers
 * @param retryPolicy Strategy for handling task failures and retries
 * 
 * @see TaskWorker
 * @see TaskMonitor
 * @see RetryPolicy
 */
class TaskScheduler(
    private val workers: List<TaskWorker>,
    private val maxConcurrency: Int = 10,
    private val retryPolicy: RetryPolicy = RetryPolicy.DEFAULT

#### Testing Strategy

Implement comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests. Use property-based testing for complex algorithms and contract testing for API interfaces.

```kotlin
// Unit testing
class TaskProcessorTest {
    private lateinit var processor: TaskProcessor
    private lateinit var mockDataProcessor: DataProcessor
    private lateinit var mockNetworkClient: NetworkClient
    
    @BeforeEach
    fun setup() {
        mockDataProcessor = mockk()
        mockNetworkClient = mockk()
        processor = TaskProcessor(mockDataProcessor, mockNetworkClient, ErrorHandler())
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should process data task successfully`() = runTest {
        // Given
        val task = Task.DataProcessingTask(
            id = "test-1",
            priority = Priority.MEDIUM,
            createdAt = Clock.System.now(),
            inputData = "test data",
            processingConfig = ProcessingConfig.DEFAULT
        )
        
        val expectedResult = TaskResult(
            taskId = "test-1",
            status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED,
            result = "processed data",
            processingTime = 100.milliseconds,
            completedAt = Clock.System.now()
        )
        
        coEvery { mockDataProcessor.process(task) } returns expectedResult
        
        // When
        val result = processor.processTask(task)
        
        // Then
        assertEquals(expectedResult, result)
        coVerify { mockDataProcessor.process(task) }
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle processing errors gracefully`() = runTest {
        // Given
        val task = Task.DataProcessingTask(/*...*/)
        coEvery { mockDataProcessor.process(task) } throws RuntimeException("Processing failed")
        
        // When
        val result = processor.processTask(task)
        
        // Then
        assertEquals(TaskStatus.FAILED, result.status)
        assertNotNull(result.error)
    }
}

// Integration testing
class TaskSchedulerIntegrationTest {
    private lateinit var scheduler: TaskScheduler
    private lateinit var testDatabase: TestDatabase
    
    @BeforeEach
    fun setup() {
        testDatabase = TestDatabase.create()
        scheduler = TaskScheduler(
            workers = listOf(TestWorker(testDatabase)),
            maxConcurrency = 5
        )
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should process multiple tasks concurrently`() = runTest {
        // Given
        val tasks = (1..10).map { createTestTask(it) }
        
        // When
        val handles = tasks.map { scheduler.submitTask(it) }
        val results = handles.map { it.await() }
        
        // Then
        assertEquals(10, results.size)
        assertTrue(results.all { it.status == TaskStatus.COMPLETED })
    }
}

// Property-based testing
class TaskProcessingPropertyTest {
    @Test
    fun `task processing should preserve task count`() {
        checkAll(Arb.list(taskArb, 1..100)) { tasks ->
            val results = runBlocking { processor.processTasks(tasks) }
            results.size shouldBe tasks.size
        }
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `successful tasks should have valid results`() {
        checkAll(validTaskArb) { task ->
            val result = runBlocking { processor.processTask(task) }
            if (result.status == TaskStatus.COMPLETED) {
                result.result shouldNotBe null
                result.completedAt shouldBeAfter task.createdAt
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Continuous Integration

Establish CI/CD pipelines that run comprehensive test suites, perform static analysis, and generate documentation. Include performance benchmarks and security scanning in the pipeline.

```kotlin
// Performance testing
class TaskSchedulerPerformanceTest {
    @Test
    fun `should handle high throughput task processing`() = runTest {
        val scheduler = TaskScheduler(
            workers = (1..10).map { TestWorker() },
            maxConcurrency = 100
        )
        
        val taskCount = 10000
        val startTime = TimeSource.Monotonic.markNow()
        
        // Submit tasks
        val handles = (1..taskCount).map {
            scheduler.submitTask(createTestTask(it))
        }
        
        // Wait for completion
        handles.forEach { it.await() }
        
        val processingTime = startTime.elapsedNow()
        val throughput = taskCount / processingTime.inWholeSeconds
        
        assertTrue(throughput > 100) // Minimum 100 tasks/second
        assertTrue(processingTime < 30.seconds) // Complete within 30 seconds
    }
}
```

**Key points**: Project selection should demonstrate multiple advanced Kotlin concepts through real-world problem solving. Implementation must systematically apply advanced language features including sophisticated type systems, coroutines, and functional programming patterns. Code review and refactoring processes ensure maintainability and performance optimization. Comprehensive documentation and testing strategies provide confidence in system reliability and facilitate team collaboration.

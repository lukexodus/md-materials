# Cloud Fundamentals

## Cloud Computing Concepts and Service Models

Cloud computing represents a paradigm shift from traditional on-premises computing infrastructure to internet-delivered computing services. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) exemplifies this transformation by providing scalable, on-demand access to computing resources without requiring physical hardware ownership or management.

**Key Points**

- Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, enabling organizations to access resources without maintaining physical infrastructure
- Resources are provisioned dynamically based on demand, allowing for elastic scaling
- Payment models typically follow a pay-as-you-use structure, reducing capital expenditure requirements

### Service Models in Google Cloud

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** Google Cloud's IaaS offerings provide virtualized computing infrastructure over the internet. Compute Engine serves as the primary IaaS service, delivering virtual machines with customizable configurations. Users maintain control over operating systems, applications, and runtime environments while Google manages the underlying physical infrastructure, networking, and storage hardware.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** App Engine represents Google Cloud's PaaS solution, providing a platform for developing and deploying applications without managing underlying infrastructure. The service automatically handles scaling, load balancing, and resource allocation. Cloud Functions extends PaaS capabilities through serverless computing, executing code in response to events without server management requirements.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) exemplifies SaaS delivery, providing fully functional applications accessible through web browsers. Users access complete software solutions without installation, maintenance, or infrastructure concerns.

## Google Cloud Global Infrastructure

Google Cloud operates one of the world's most extensive global infrastructure networks, designed for high availability, low latency, and robust performance across geographic regions.

### Regional Architecture

Google Cloud organizes its infrastructure into regions and zones. Regions represent independent geographic areas containing multiple isolated locations called zones. Each region typically contains three or more zones, providing redundancy and fault tolerance within the regional boundary.

**Examples**

- us-central1 (Iowa) contains zones us-central1-a, us-central1-b, us-central1-c, and us-central1-f
- europe-west1 (Belgium) includes zones europe-west1-b, europe-west1-c, and europe-west1-d
- asia-southeast1 (Singapore) comprises zones asia-southeast1-a, asia-southeast1-b, and asia-southeast1-c

### Network Infrastructure

Google's global network connects regions through high-speed fiber optic cables and submarine cables. The premium tier network routes traffic through Google's private network infrastructure, while the standard tier uses public internet routing. Edge locations and points of presence (PoPs) reduce latency by positioning resources closer to end users.

### Multi-Region Resources

Certain Google Cloud services operate across multiple regions automatically, providing global availability and data replication. Cloud Storage multi-regional buckets, for instance, store data across multiple regions within a continent, ensuring durability and accessibility even during regional outages.

## Projects, Billing, and Resource Hierarchy

Google Cloud employs a hierarchical organizational structure that enables systematic resource management, access control, and billing administration.

### Project Structure

Projects serve as the fundamental organizational unit in Google Cloud, containing all resources, services, and configurations. Each project receives a unique project ID and project number for identification purposes. Resources within a project can communicate freely by default, while cross-project communication requires explicit configuration.

**Key Points**

- Projects isolate resources and provide billing boundaries
- Project IDs must be globally unique and cannot be changed after creation
- Projects can be organized under folders and organizations for hierarchical management

### Resource Hierarchy

The Google Cloud resource hierarchy follows a four-level structure: Organization → Folders → Projects → Resources.

**Organization Level** The organization represents the root node, typically corresponding to a company or institution. Organization-level policies apply to all resources within the hierarchy, providing centralized governance and security controls.

**Folder Level** Folders provide intermediate grouping between organizations and projects, enabling departmental or team-based organization. Folders can contain other folders or projects, creating flexible hierarchical structures that reflect organizational structures.

**Project Level** Projects contain actual Google Cloud resources and services. All billable resources belong to a project, and projects serve as the boundary for resource quotas and limits.

**Resource Level** Individual resources (virtual machines, storage buckets, databases) exist within projects and inherit policies from higher hierarchy levels.

### Billing Administration

Google Cloud billing operates at the project level, with billing accounts managing payment methods and invoicing. Multiple projects can associate with a single billing account, enabling centralized cost management across organizational units.

Billing accounts contain payment instruments (credit cards, bank transfers, purchase orders) and receive invoices for resource consumption across associated projects. Budget alerts and spending controls help organizations monitor and control cloud expenditures.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics

IAM provides centralized access control for Google Cloud resources, implementing the principle of least privilege through granular permission management.

### IAM Components

**Identities** IAM recognizes several identity types: Google accounts (individual users), service accounts (applications and virtual machines), Google groups (collections of users), and Google Workspace domains (organizational accounts).

**Resources** Every Google Cloud service and resource integrates with IAM, allowing fine-grained access control at the resource level.

**Permissions** Permissions define specific actions that can be performed on resources. Permissions follow the format service.resource.verb, such as compute.instances.create or storage.buckets.list.

**Roles** Roles bundle related permissions into logical groupings. Google Cloud provides three role types:

- **Basic roles**: Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles providing broad access levels
- **Predefined roles**: Service-specific roles with curated permission sets
- **Custom roles**: Organization-defined roles with precisely specified permissions

### Policy Structure

IAM policies define who (identity) has what access (role) to which resources. Policies attach to resources and specify member-role bindings. Policy inheritance flows down the resource hierarchy, with more specific policies potentially overriding inherited permissions.

**Examples** A policy might grant the role roles/compute.instanceAdmin to user john@example.com on all Compute Engine instances within a specific project.

### Service Accounts

Service accounts provide identity for applications and services, enabling programmatic access to Google Cloud resources. Applications use service account credentials to authenticate API calls and access authorized resources.

Service accounts generate cryptographic keys for authentication, either through automatically managed keys or user-managed keys for enhanced security control.

## Google Cloud Console and CLI Introduction

Google Cloud provides multiple interfaces for resource management and service interaction, accommodating different user preferences and operational requirements.

### Google Cloud Console

The web-based Google Cloud Console offers a graphical interface for managing Google Cloud resources. The console provides dashboards, resource browsers, monitoring tools, and configuration interfaces accessible through web browsers.

**Key Points**

- Responsive web interface accessible from any device with internet connectivity
- Integrated monitoring and logging views for operational oversight
- Visual resource creation wizards for simplified deployment processes
- Built-in Cloud Shell providing browser-based command-line access

### Navigation Structure

The console organizes services into logical categories: Compute, Storage, Networking, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Operations. The navigation menu provides quick access to frequently used services, while the search functionality enables rapid resource location across projects.

Project selection controls appear prominently in the console header, allowing users to switch contexts between different projects and their associated resources.

### Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)

The command-line interface provides programmatic access to Google Cloud services through the gcloud command-line tool. The CLI supports scripting, automation, and bulk operations that may be cumbersome through the graphical interface.

**Installation and Configuration** The Google Cloud CLI installs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Initial configuration requires authentication and default project specification through the gcloud init command.

**Examples**

```bash
gcloud compute instances create my-vm --zone=us-central1-a
gcloud storage buckets create gs://my-unique-bucket-name
gcloud projects list
```

### Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell provides a browser-based terminal with pre-installed Google Cloud CLI tools, eliminating local installation requirements. The service includes a temporary virtual machine with 5GB persistent disk storage and integrated code editor functionality.

**Key Points**

- No local software installation required
- Automatically authenticated with current Google Cloud Console session
- Includes popular development tools and language runtimes
- Persistent home directory across sessions

### API and SDK Access

Google Cloud services expose RESTful APIs enabling programmatic integration. Client libraries provide native language support for popular programming languages including Python, Java, Node.js, Go, and .NET.

The APIs follow consistent authentication patterns using service account credentials or user authentication flows. Rate limiting and quotas protect services from excessive usage while ensuring fair resource allocation across users.

**Output** Understanding these cloud fundamentals establishes the foundation for effectively utilizing Google Cloud Platform services. The hierarchical organization model, combined with comprehensive IAM controls, enables scalable and secure cloud deployments. Multiple access interfaces accommodate different operational preferences while maintaining consistent functionality across platforms.

**Next Steps** Consider exploring specific Google Cloud services like Compute Engine for virtual machines, Cloud Storage for object storage, or App Engine for application deployment. Understanding billing optimization strategies and implementing robust IAM policies will enhance operational efficiency and security posture.

# Security and Compliance in Google Cloud Platform

## IAM Roles and Permissions

Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management system implements a sophisticated permission model that enables precise access control through hierarchical role assignments and granular permission management.

### Permission Structure

Permissions in Google Cloud follow a standardized naming convention: `service.resource.verb`. Each permission grants the ability to perform a specific action on a particular resource type. For example, `compute.instances.create` allows creating Compute Engine instances, while `storage.objects.get` enables reading objects from Cloud Storage buckets.

Permissions cannot be assigned directly to users; they must be bundled into roles. This design ensures consistent permission groupings and simplifies administrative overhead while maintaining security boundaries.

### Role Categories

**Basic Roles (Legacy)** Basic roles provide broad access across Google Cloud services. The Viewer role (`roles/viewer`) grants read-only access to most resources, Editor role (`roles/editor`) includes Viewer permissions plus modification capabilities, and Owner role (`roles/owner`) encompasses Editor permissions with additional administrative rights including billing account management and IAM policy modification.

[Inference] Basic roles are considered legacy because they grant overly broad permissions that may violate the principle of least privilege in many organizational contexts.

**Predefined Roles** Google Cloud maintains hundreds of predefined roles tailored to specific services and use cases. These roles contain curated permission sets that align with common job functions and operational requirements. Examples include `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1` for Compute Engine instance management, `roles/storage.objectAdmin` for Cloud Storage object administration, and `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` for BigQuery dataset read access.

**Custom Roles** Organizations can create custom roles containing precisely specified permission combinations. Custom roles enable fine-grained access control that aligns with organizational security policies and operational requirements. Custom roles can include permissions from multiple services and can be more restrictive than predefined roles.

### Role Assignment and Policy Management

IAM policies define the relationship between identities (who), resources (what), and roles (permissions). Policies can be set at organization, folder, project, or individual resource levels, with inheritance flowing down the hierarchy.

**Conditional Access** IAM supports conditional role bindings through Cloud IAM Conditions. Conditions enable dynamic access control based on attributes such as time of day, IP address ranges, device security status, or resource attributes. This capability supports zero-trust security models and compliance requirements for sensitive environments.

**Examples**

- Granting database admin access only during business hours: `request.time.getHours() >= 9 && request.time.getHours() <= 17`
- Restricting access to specific IP ranges: `origin.ip in ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24"]`

### Policy Troubleshooting and Analysis

The IAM Policy Troubleshooter analyzes why a user can or cannot access specific resources by examining the complete policy hierarchy. The Policy Analyzer provides insights into permission grants and helps identify overprivileged accounts or unused permissions.

Policy Intelligence recommendations identify overly permissive roles and suggest more restrictive alternatives based on actual resource usage patterns. [Inference] These tools likely use machine learning algorithms to analyze access patterns, though the specific implementation details are not publicly documented.

## Service Accounts

Service accounts provide cryptographic identity for applications, services, and automated processes, enabling secure programmatic access to Google Cloud resources without requiring human user credentials.

### Service Account Types

**User-managed Service Accounts** Organizations create and manage these service accounts within their projects. User-managed service accounts support custom naming, description, and lifecycle management according to organizational policies. These accounts can have multiple cryptographic key pairs and support both Google-managed and user-managed key rotation.

**Google-managed Service Accounts** Google Cloud automatically creates service accounts for certain services, such as the Compute Engine default service account and App Engine service accounts. These accounts enable services to access other Google Cloud resources on behalf of the user's project.

### Authentication Methods

**Service Account Keys** Service accounts can authenticate using cryptographic key pairs. Google-managed keys rotate automatically and are stored securely within Google Cloud infrastructure. User-managed keys provide additional control but require manual rotation and secure storage by the organization.

**Workload Identity Federation** This authentication method enables external identity providers (AWS, Azure, GitHub Actions, OIDC providers) to impersonate Google Cloud service accounts without storing long-lived credentials. Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need to download and manage service account keys in external environments.

**Examples**

- GitHub Actions workflows can authenticate to Google Cloud using Workload Identity Federation by configuring the GitHub OIDC token to map to a Google Cloud service account
- AWS Lambda functions can access Google Cloud services through cross-cloud identity federation

### Service Account Security Best Practices

Service account impersonation allows users or other service accounts to act as a service account without accessing its keys directly. This capability supports credential management and reduces the attack surface by avoiding key distribution.

The `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role enables short-term token generation for service account impersonation. These tokens have limited lifespans and can include scope restrictions for additional security.

**Key Points**

- Regularly audit service account usage and permissions
- Implement key rotation policies for user-managed keys
- Use service account impersonation instead of key distribution where possible
- Apply the principle of least privilege to service account role assignments

## Cloud Security Command Center

Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) provides centralized security management and monitoring across Google Cloud environments, offering threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and security posture management capabilities.

### Security Findings and Asset Discovery

Security Command Center continuously discovers and inventories assets across Google Cloud projects, including compute instances, storage buckets, databases, and network configurations. The asset discovery process creates a comprehensive security inventory that updates in real-time as resources change.

Security findings represent potential security issues, misconfigurations, or threats detected across the environment. Findings include severity levels, affected resources, remediation recommendations, and contextual information for security analysis.

### Built-in Security Sources

**Security Health Analytics** This built-in detector identifies common security misconfigurations such as public storage buckets, overprivileged service accounts, unencrypted resources, and firewall rule violations. Security Health Analytics operates continuously without requiring additional configuration.

**Web Security Scanner** The scanner automatically discovers web applications deployed on Google Cloud and performs vulnerability scanning for common web application security issues including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and outdated software components.

**Binary Authorization Findings** When Binary Authorization is enabled, Security Command Center displays findings related to container image policy violations, unsigned images, and attestation failures.

### Third-party Security Integrations

Security Command Center supports integration with third-party security tools through the Security Command Center API. Partner integrations include vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence platforms, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and specialized security tools.

**Examples**

- Qualys vulnerability scanner findings appear alongside native Google Cloud security findings
- Twistlock container security findings integrate with Security Command Center dashboards
- Chronicle SIEM can ingest Security Command Center findings for correlation analysis

### Security Marks and Custom Properties

Organizations can apply security marks to assets and findings to support custom categorization, workflow automation, and policy enforcement. Security marks enable tagging resources with business context, compliance requirements, or operational metadata.

**Output** Security Command Center provides exportable data through BigQuery Export, enabling custom analytics, reporting, and integration with existing security operations workflows. The export includes historical finding data and asset inventory changes over time.

## Binary Authorization

Binary Authorization ensures that only trusted container images deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud Run environments through cryptographic attestation and policy enforcement.

### Attestation Framework

Binary Authorization requires attestations from designated authorities before allowing container image deployment. Attestations represent cryptographic signatures confirming that images meet organizational security requirements such as vulnerability scanning, code review, or compliance verification.

**Attestor Configuration** Attestors represent trusted authorities that can vouch for container images. Each attestor has associated cryptographic keys used to verify attestation signatures. Organizations typically configure multiple attestors representing different verification stages in their software development lifecycle.

**Examples**

- A vulnerability scanner attestor confirms that images contain no high-severity vulnerabilities
- A code review attestor verifies that images correspond to reviewed code changes
- A compliance attestor ensures images meet regulatory requirements

### Policy Enforcement

Binary Authorization policies define deployment requirements for different environments, projects, or namespaces. Policies specify which attestors must provide attestations before deployment proceeds, enabling flexible security requirements across organizational boundaries.

**Policy Rules** Policies support conditional logic based on image properties, cluster characteristics, or namespace attributes. This capability enables different security requirements for development, staging, and production environments while maintaining centralized policy management.

**Breakglass Procedures** Emergency deployment procedures allow authorized users to override Binary Authorization policies during critical incidents. Breakglass actions generate audit logs and require explicit justification for security review and compliance documentation.

### Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

Binary Authorization integrates with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines through attestation generation during build processes. Automated attestation creation enables security verification without disrupting development velocity.

Build systems create attestations after successful security scans, quality gates, or approval processes. These attestations accompany container images through the deployment pipeline, providing deployment authorization when policy requirements are satisfied.

## Cloud KMS (Key Management)

Cloud Key Management Service provides centralized cryptographic key management with hardware security module (HSM) protection, key rotation capabilities, and comprehensive audit logging.

### Key Management Hierarchy

**Key Rings** Key rings provide administrative groupings for cryptographic keys within specific locations and projects. Key rings define IAM policy boundaries and enable bulk key management operations. Keys within a key ring share location and project context but maintain individual access controls.

**Keys and Key Versions** Cryptographic keys contain multiple versions, with each version representing distinct key material. Key rotation creates new key versions while preserving access to previous versions for data encrypted with older key material. This design enables seamless key rotation without data loss or service disruption.

### Protection Levels

**Software Protection** Software-protected keys store key material in Google Cloud's secure software infrastructure with encryption at rest and strict access controls. Software protection provides strong security suitable for most enterprise applications while offering the highest performance and lowest latency.

**Hardware Security Module (HSM) Protection** HSM-protected keys store key material in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated hardware security modules. HSMs provide additional security assurance through tamper-resistant hardware that destroys key material if physical intrusion is detected.

**External Key Manager (EKM)** EKM enables organizations to maintain cryptographic keys in external key management systems while leveraging Google Cloud services for data processing. This approach supports regulatory requirements or organizational policies requiring external key control.

### Cryptographic Operations

Cloud KMS supports symmetric encryption/decryption, asymmetric encryption/decryption, and digital signing operations. Applications can perform cryptographic operations through Cloud KMS APIs without accessing raw key material, maintaining key security while enabling cryptographic functionality.

**Envelope Encryption** Google Cloud services commonly implement envelope encryption, where Cloud KMS encrypts data encryption keys (DEKs) that protect actual data. This approach reduces Cloud KMS API calls while maintaining centralized key control and audit capabilities.

**Examples**

- Cloud Storage uses envelope encryption with Cloud KMS customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
- Compute Engine persistent disks can encrypt data using Cloud KMS keys
- BigQuery datasets support CMEK for table and query result encryption

### Key Access Controls and Audit

Cloud KMS integrates with Cloud IAM for granular access control over key operations. Permissions include key usage rights (encrypt/decrypt), key management rights (create/delete), and administrative rights (IAM policy modification).

All Cloud KMS operations generate detailed audit logs through Cloud Audit Logs, providing complete visibility into key usage, access attempts, and administrative changes. Audit logs include caller identity, operation details, and timestamp information for security monitoring and compliance reporting.

## VPC Security Controls

Virtual Private Cloud security controls implement network-level security through firewall rules, network segmentation, and traffic inspection capabilities that protect Google Cloud resources from unauthorized network access.

### VPC Firewall Rules

VPC firewall rules control traffic flow between resources within Google Cloud networks and external networks. Firewall rules operate at the network level and can allow or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and network tags.

**Firewall Rule Components**

- **Direction**: Ingress (incoming) or egress (outgoing) traffic
- **Action**: Allow or deny matching traffic
- **Targets**: Resources affected by the rule (all instances, tagged instances, or service accounts)
- **Source/Destination**: IP ranges, tags, or service accounts for traffic matching
- **Protocols and Ports**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or other protocols with specific port ranges

**Hierarchical Firewall Policies** Organization-level firewall policies enable centralized security rule management across multiple projects and networks. Hierarchical policies support consistent security controls while allowing project-level customization within organizational boundaries.

### Network Segmentation

**Subnetworks** VPC subnetworks provide IP address space segmentation within regions, enabling network isolation and traffic control between different application tiers or organizational units. Subnetworks can span multiple zones within a region while maintaining network boundaries.

**Private Google Access** Private Google Access enables resources in private subnetworks to reach Google Cloud services without external IP addresses. This capability supports secure architectures that minimize internet exposure while maintaining service connectivity.

**VPC Peering** VPC peering connects different VPC networks, enabling resource communication across projects or organizations while maintaining network isolation from the public internet. Peered networks can implement selective routing and firewall controls.

### Advanced Security Features

**Cloud NAT** Cloud Network Address Translation (NAT) provides outbound internet connectivity for resources without external IP addresses. Cloud NAT supports secure internet access patterns while maintaining inbound traffic isolation.

**Cloud Load Balancing Security** Google Cloud Load Balancers integrate with Cloud Armor for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities. Load balancers can implement SSL/TLS termination and HTTP(S) security headers.

**Private Service Connect** Private Service Connect enables secure connectivity to Google Cloud services and third-party services through internal IP addresses, eliminating internet transit and reducing attack surface exposure.

### VPC Flow Logs

VPC Flow Logs capture network flow information for traffic analysis, security monitoring, and compliance reporting. Flow logs record source and destination information, packet counts, byte counts, and protocol details for network traffic within VPC networks.

**Examples** Flow log analysis can identify unusual network patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or data exfiltration activities through network traffic analysis and anomaly detection.

## Audit Logging and Monitoring

Google Cloud's audit logging and monitoring capabilities provide comprehensive visibility into resource access, configuration changes, and system events across all cloud services.

### Cloud Audit Logs

Cloud Audit Logs automatically record administrative activities, data access events, and system events across Google Cloud services. Audit logs provide immutable records of who performed what action on which resource at what time.

**Log Types**

- **Admin Activity Logs**: Administrative operations that modify resource configuration or metadata
- **Data Access Logs**: Operations that read or modify user data (disabled by default due to volume)
- **System Event Logs**: Google Cloud system operations that affect resources
- **Policy Denied Logs**: Operations denied due to security policies or insufficient permissions

### Log Export and Retention

**Cloud Logging Retention** Cloud Logging retains audit logs for 400 days by default, providing extensive historical access for security investigations and compliance reporting. Organizations can export logs to Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub for extended retention and analysis.

**Structured Log Export** Log exports support filtering and routing based on log content, severity levels, resource types, or custom criteria. This capability enables selective log archival and real-time security event processing.

**Examples**

- Export high-severity security events to a SIEM system through Pub/Sub
- Archive all audit logs to Cloud Storage with lifecycle management for cost optimization
- Stream authentication failures to BigQuery for security analytics

### Security Monitoring Integration

**Cloud Security Command Center Integration** Audit logs feed into Security Command Center findings generation, enabling automated threat detection based on access patterns, configuration changes, or policy violations. This integration supports real-time security monitoring and incident response workflows.

**Custom Security Analytics** Organizations can implement custom security analytics using BigQuery SQL queries against exported audit logs. This capability supports advanced threat hunting, compliance reporting, and security metric generation.

### Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

**Cloud Monitoring Policies** Cloud Monitoring can create alerting policies based on audit log events, enabling real-time notification of security events or policy violations. Alert policies support complex conditions and multiple notification channels including email, SMS, and webhook integrations.

**Log-based Metrics** Log-based metrics extract numeric values from audit logs, enabling dashboard visualization and threshold-based alerting. These metrics can track authentication failures, privileged access events, or resource modification patterns.

**Key Points**

- Audit logs are automatically generated and cannot be modified or deleted by users
- Log integrity is cryptographically protected through digital signatures
- Audit logs support compliance with various regulatory frameworks including SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS
- Real-time log analysis enables rapid incident detection and response

**Next Steps** Consider implementing comprehensive log export strategies, establishing security monitoring dashboards, and developing incident response procedures based on audit log analysis.

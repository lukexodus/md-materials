# Fundamentals

## Cloud Computing Concepts and Service Models

Cloud computing represents a paradigm shift from traditional on-premises infrastructure to internet-based computing resources. The fundamental principle involves delivering computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

**Key Points**

The three primary service models define different levels of control and responsibility:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users rent IT infrastructure including servers, virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-use basis. Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, and Azure Virtual Network exemplify IaaS offerings. Organizations maintain control over operating systems, applications, and middleware while the cloud provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) delivers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development. PaaS provides a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, including infrastructure, middleware, development tools, business intelligence services, database management systems, and more. Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Functions represent PaaS solutions. Developers can focus on building applications without managing underlying infrastructure complexities.

Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. The cloud provider hosts and manages the software application and underlying infrastructure, handling maintenance, software upgrades, and security patching. Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure DevOps Services demonstrate SaaS implementations. Users access applications through web browsers without installation or maintenance responsibilities.

Cloud deployment models determine how cloud services are made available:

Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers, delivering computing resources like servers and storage over the internet. Multiple organizations share the same infrastructure, creating cost efficiencies through economies of scale.

Private clouds consist of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. Private clouds can be physically located at an organization's on-site datacenter or hosted by a third-party service provider.

Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. This approach provides greater flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure, security, and compliance requirements.

Community clouds serve a specific community of consumers from organizations with shared concerns such as security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations.

## Azure Global Infrastructure and Regions

Azure's global infrastructure spans multiple geographic locations worldwide, designed to provide high availability, disaster recovery capabilities, and compliance with data residency requirements. The infrastructure architecture consists of several hierarchical components.

**Key Points**

Azure regions represent geographic locations containing one or more datacenters connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. Each region is designed to offer protection against local disasters through availability zones and paired with another region within the same geography for disaster recovery purposes. As of early 2025, Azure operates in over 60 regions across more than 140 countries [Unverified - exact current numbers may vary].

Availability zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region, each containing one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. The zones are connected through high-performance networks with round-trip latency of less than 2ms. Not all regions support availability zones, but those that do provide enhanced fault tolerance for mission-critical applications.

Region pairs consist of two regions within the same geography, typically separated by at least 300 miles. Azure replicates some services automatically across region pairs to provide disaster recovery capabilities. Updates are deployed to paired regions sequentially to minimize downtime risks. Examples include East US paired with West US, and North Europe paired with West Europe.

Azure geographies represent discrete markets that preserve data residency and compliance boundaries. Each geography contains multiple regions and maintains data residency within geographic boundaries for compliance purposes. Major geographies include Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa.

Edge locations and Azure Edge Zones extend Azure services closer to end users and devices. These locations host Azure services like Azure CDN, Azure Front Door, and Azure Stack Edge to reduce latency and improve performance for geographically distributed applications.

**Examples**

A multinational corporation might deploy their primary application in East US region with automatic replication to West US for disaster recovery. They could utilize availability zones within East US to distribute application components across multiple datacenters, ensuring high availability even if one datacenter experiences issues.

An organization with strict data sovereignty requirements in Europe might choose to deploy all resources within the Europe geography, utilizing North Europe and West Europe regions to meet both compliance and disaster recovery needs.

## Azure Subscription and Resource Management

Azure subscriptions serve as logical containers for Azure resources and define billing boundaries, access control scopes, and resource organization structures. Understanding subscription management is fundamental to effective Azure governance and cost control.

**Key Points**

Azure subscriptions represent agreements with Microsoft to use Azure services, establishing billing relationships and access boundaries. Each subscription has associated limits and quotas for various Azure services. Organizations can maintain multiple subscriptions for different departments, projects, or environments to separate billing, access control, and resource management.

Subscription types include several options based on organizational needs:

Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions charge for actual usage without upfront commitments, ideal for development, testing, and variable workloads. Enterprise Agreement subscriptions provide volume licensing with negotiated rates for large organizations making significant Azure commitments. Free tier subscriptions offer limited free services for learning and experimentation. Student subscriptions provide free credits for educational purposes.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants provide identity and access management for Azure subscriptions. A tenant represents an organization's instance of Azure AD, containing users, groups, and applications. Subscriptions are associated with Azure AD tenants, enabling identity-based access control across Azure resources.

Management groups provide a hierarchical structure above subscriptions, enabling policy and access management across multiple subscriptions. Organizations can create management group hierarchies reflecting their organizational structure, applying governance policies consistently across related subscriptions.

Resource groups act as logical containers for Azure resources within a subscription. All resources must belong to exactly one resource group, which defines their lifecycle, access control, and billing scope. Resource groups enable collective management of related resources and provide a natural boundary for role-based access control.

Billing and cost management capabilities include detailed usage tracking, budgets, alerts, and cost analysis tools. Azure Cost Management provides insights into spending patterns, enabling optimization recommendations and cost control measures.

**Examples**

A large enterprise might structure their Azure environment with a root management group containing separate management groups for Production, Development, and Sandbox environments. Each environment contains multiple subscriptions for different business units, with resource groups organizing related resources within each subscription.

A development team might use separate resource groups for different application components, such as web-app-rg for web application resources, database-rg for database resources, and monitoring-rg for application monitoring tools.

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

Azure Resource Manager serves as the deployment and management service for Azure, providing a unified management layer for all Azure resources. ARM enables consistent management operations across different Azure services and tools through a common API.

**Key Points**

ARM templates define infrastructure and configuration as code using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Templates describe Azure resources, their properties, dependencies, and configuration parameters in a declarative manner. This approach enables repeatable deployments, version control, and infrastructure automation.

Resource providers represent the services available through ARM, such as Microsoft.Compute for virtual machines, Microsoft.Storage for storage accounts, and Microsoft.Network for networking resources. Each resource provider offers specific resource types with defined properties and capabilities.

Deployment modes determine how ARM processes template deployments. Incremental mode adds or updates resources defined in the template without affecting existing resources not specified in the template. Complete mode ensures the resource group contains only resources defined in the template, removing any resources not specified.

ARM template structure includes several key sections:

The schema section specifies the template format version and resource provider versions. Parameters section defines input values that customize deployments for different environments. Variables section contains values computed from parameters or other template elements. Resources section declares the Azure resources to deploy with their configurations. Outputs section returns values from deployed resources for use in other templates or processes.

Template functions provide built-in capabilities for manipulating values, generating unique names, referencing other resources, and performing calculations within templates. Common functions include resourceGroup(), parameters(), variables(), and concat().

Linked and nested templates enable modular template design by referencing other templates. This approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns in complex deployments.

**Examples**

A basic ARM template might define a storage account with parameters for storage account name, location, and performance tier. The template would include parameter validation, generate a unique storage account name using template functions, and output the storage account's primary endpoint for use by other systems.

An enterprise application deployment might use a master template that links to separate templates for networking infrastructure, database services, application services, and monitoring components. Each linked template focuses on specific infrastructure aspects while the master template orchestrates the overall deployment.

## Azure Portal, CLI, and PowerShell

Azure provides multiple management interfaces to accommodate different user preferences, automation requirements, and operational scenarios. These tools offer varying levels of functionality and integration capabilities.

**Key Points**

Azure Portal provides a web-based graphical user interface for managing Azure resources through any modern web browser. The portal offers visual dashboards, resource browsing capabilities, monitoring charts, and guided experiences for complex operations. Users can customize dashboards, create resource favorites, and access integrated tools like Cloud Shell directly within the portal interface.

Portal capabilities include resource creation wizards that guide users through deployment processes, integrated monitoring and alerting dashboards, role-based access control management, and cost management tools. The portal provides context-sensitive help and documentation links throughout the interface.

Azure CLI represents a cross-platform command-line interface available for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. CLI commands follow a consistent noun-verb syntax pattern, such as "az vm create" for creating virtual machines. The CLI supports interactive mode with auto-completion and contextual help, as well as batch mode for automated operations.

CLI features include JSON output formatting for programmatic processing, JMESPath query capabilities for filtering and transforming results, extension system for additional functionality, and integration with popular development tools and CI/CD pipelines.

Azure PowerShell provides cmdlets that wrap Azure REST APIs, offering object-oriented management capabilities familiar to Windows administrators. PowerShell cmdlets follow verb-noun naming conventions, such as New-AzVM for creating virtual machines. The module integrates with existing PowerShell scripts and automation frameworks.

PowerShell capabilities include pipeline support for chaining operations, rich object manipulation, integration with Windows management tools, and extensive scripting capabilities for complex automation scenarios.

Cloud Shell provides browser-based shell environments with pre-installed Azure CLI and PowerShell tools. Cloud Shell includes persistent file storage, integrated code editor, and authentication to Azure subscriptions without additional configuration. Both Bash and PowerShell environments are available.

Azure mobile apps enable resource monitoring, basic management operations, and alert responses from mobile devices. The apps provide push notifications for critical alerts, quick actions for common operations, and integration with Azure Active Directory for secure authentication.

**Examples**

A system administrator might use the Azure Portal for initial resource exploration and dashboard creation, Azure CLI for automated deployment scripts in CI/CD pipelines, and PowerShell for complex resource management tasks integrated with existing Windows-based management tools.

A development team might create ARM templates using Visual Studio Code, deploy them using Azure CLI commands in their build pipeline, monitor deployments through the Azure Portal, and troubleshoot issues using Cloud Shell when working remotely.

**Output**

This comprehensive overview covers the fundamental aspects of Azure cloud computing, from basic service models to specific management tools. Understanding these concepts provides the foundation for effective Azure resource management and cloud solution architecture. The interconnected nature of these components creates a cohesive platform for enterprise cloud adoption and digital transformation initiatives.

# Identity and Access Management

Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) serves as the foundational security layer for Microsoft's cloud platform, providing comprehensive identity services, access controls, and security policies that protect organizational resources and data. This system enables organizations to manage user identities, control access to applications and resources, and maintain security compliance across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Azure Active Directory functions as Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service, serving as the central identity provider for Azure resources and integrated applications. Azure AD operates as a multi-tenant, cloud-based directory service that provides identity management capabilities for users, groups, applications, and devices.

The service supports various identity types including cloud-only identities, synchronized identities from on-premises Active Directory, and federated identities from external identity providers. Azure AD manages authentication and authorization for Microsoft 365, Azure services, and thousands of third-party applications through its extensive application gallery.

**Key Points:**

- Centralized identity management for cloud and on-premises resources
- Support for B2B collaboration and B2C customer identity scenarios
- Integration with over 2,800 pre-integrated applications
- Self-service password reset and group management capabilities
- Advanced threat protection through Identity Protection services

Azure AD licensing operates across multiple tiers: Free, Office 365 Apps, Premium P1, and Premium P2, with each tier providing progressively advanced features including conditional access, identity protection, and privileged identity management.

## Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Azure AD requires users to provide additional verification factors beyond username and password, significantly reducing the risk of account compromise. Azure MFA supports various authentication methods including phone calls, SMS messages, mobile app notifications, and hardware tokens.

The service integrates seamlessly with Azure AD and can be applied selectively through conditional access policies or globally across all user accounts. Azure MFA provides detailed reporting and monitoring capabilities, allowing administrators to track authentication patterns and identify potential security threats.

**Example:** A user logging into Azure portal first enters their credentials, then receives a push notification on their Microsoft Authenticator app requiring approval before access is granted.

Organizations can customize MFA settings including trusted IP ranges, app passwords for legacy applications, and fraud alert configurations. The service supports both cloud-based and on-premises MFA server deployments, though Microsoft recommends the cloud-based approach for new implementations.

Authentication methods vary in security strength and user convenience. Microsoft Authenticator app provides the highest security through certificate-based authentication, while SMS and phone calls offer broader compatibility but lower security due to potential SIM swapping and phone interception attacks.

## Conditional Access Policies

Conditional access policies function as if-then statements that evaluate signals including user identity, location, device state, application, and risk level to make access decisions. These policies enable organizations to implement zero-trust security principles by continuously evaluating access requests based on real-time risk assessment.

Policy components include assignments (who, what, where) and access controls (grant or block access with specific requirements). Assignments define users and groups, cloud applications, and conditions such as location, device platforms, and client applications. Access controls specify whether to grant access, block access, or grant access with additional requirements like MFA or device compliance.

**Key Points:**

- Location-based access controls using named locations and IP ranges
- Device-based policies requiring compliant or domain-joined devices
- Application-specific access controls with different security requirements
- Risk-based policies leveraging Azure AD Identity Protection signals
- Session controls for monitoring and limiting user activities

Common conditional access scenarios include requiring MFA for administrative roles, blocking access from untrusted locations, requiring managed devices for sensitive applications, and implementing step-up authentication for high-risk activities.

Policy deployment follows a phased approach: report-only mode for testing impact, pilot deployment to limited user groups, and full production rollout with continuous monitoring. Microsoft recommends creating baseline security policies covering all users, administrators, and legacy authentication protocols.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Azure RBAC provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources through role assignments that combine security principals, role definitions, and scope. This system enables organizations to grant users only the access they need to perform their job functions, following the principle of least privilege.

RBAC operates on three fundamental components: security principals (users, groups, service principals, managed identities), role definitions (collections of permissions), and scope (resources where access applies). Role assignments create the relationship between these components, determining what actions principals can perform on specific resources.

Azure provides over 70 built-in roles covering common scenarios, including Owner, Contributor, Reader, and specialized roles for specific services like Virtual Machine Contributor or SQL Database Contributor. Custom roles enable organizations to create precise permission sets tailored to their specific requirements.

**Example:** A database administrator might have SQL Database Contributor role assigned at the resource group scope, allowing them to manage all SQL databases within that resource group but no access to virtual machines or storage accounts.

Scope inheritance flows from higher levels (management groups, subscriptions) to lower levels (resource groups, individual resources). Users can have multiple role assignments across different scopes, with permissions being additive rather than restrictive.

## Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate risks associated with excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on important resources. PIM enables organizations to implement just-in-time privileged access, reducing the attack surface while maintaining operational efficiency.

PIM supports both Azure AD roles for managing Azure AD and Office 365 resources, and Azure resource roles for managing Azure subscriptions and resources. The service provides comprehensive auditing, alerting, and access reviews for privileged roles, ensuring continuous governance of elevated permissions.

**Key Points:**

- Just-in-time privileged access with configurable activation duration
- Multi-stage approval workflows for role activation requests
- Access reviews for regular certification of privileged role assignments
- Security alerts for suspicious privileged access patterns
- Integration with conditional access for additional security requirements

Role activation requires justification and can include additional requirements such as MFA, approval from designated approvers, or specific time windows. Organizations can configure different activation settings for each role, balancing security requirements with operational needs.

PIM provides detailed audit logs and reporting capabilities, enabling security teams to monitor privileged access patterns and identify potential security risks. The service generates alerts for various scenarios including roles assigned outside of PIM, permanent role assignments, and suspicious activation patterns.

## Azure AD Connect and Hybrid Identity

Azure AD Connect enables hybrid identity scenarios by synchronizing on-premises Active Directory identities with Azure AD, providing users with a common identity for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources. This synchronization maintains consistency between identity stores while enabling cloud-based identity management capabilities.

The service supports multiple synchronization options including password hash synchronization, pass-through authentication, and federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). Each option provides different security characteristics and operational requirements, allowing organizations to choose the approach that best fits their security and compliance needs.

**Example:** An organization using password hash synchronization can enable users to sign into both on-premises applications and Office 365 with the same credentials, while Azure AD handles authentication for cloud services using synchronized password hashes.

Azure AD Connect Health provides monitoring and insights for the hybrid identity infrastructure, including synchronization status, authentication performance, and security alerts. This monitoring capability ensures the reliability and security of the identity synchronization process.

**Key Points:**

- Bidirectional synchronization of users, groups, and other objects
- Support for multiple forests and domains in complex environments
- Automatic failover and disaster recovery capabilities
- Integration with Azure AD self-service capabilities for hybrid users
- Compliance with various regulatory requirements through audit logging

Deployment considerations include server requirements, network connectivity, and security hardening. Microsoft provides detailed guidance for securing Azure AD Connect servers and monitoring synchronization health to ensure reliable hybrid identity operations.

**Output:** Organizations implementing comprehensive Azure IAM typically achieve reduced identity management overhead, improved security posture through conditional access and MFA, simplified user experience with single sign-on capabilities, and enhanced compliance through detailed auditing and access governance. The integrated approach enables zero-trust security architectures while maintaining user productivity and operational efficiency.

**Next Steps:** Consider exploring advanced Azure AD features including Identity Protection for risk-based policies, Azure AD B2B for partner collaboration, Azure AD Domain Services for lift-and-shift scenarios, and integration patterns with third-party identity providers for comprehensive identity federation.

Resource deployment within VNets follows specific networking rules where resources receive private IP addresses from the subnet range and can optionally be assigned public IP addresses for internet connectivity. Network interfaces attached to virtual machines enable communication within the VNet and external networks based on routing and security configurations.

VNet peering enables connectivity between VNets within the same region or across different regions, creating hub-and-spoke topologies or mesh network architectures. Peered VNets appear as a single network to connected resources while maintaining separate administrative boundaries and billing scopes.

## Network Security Groups (NSG)

Network Security Groups function as distributed firewalls that control network traffic to and from Azure resources through security rules that allow or deny traffic based on source, destination, port, and protocol. NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces, providing multiple layers of network security control.

Security rules within NSGs are processed by priority, with lower numbers taking precedence over higher numbers. Each rule specifies action (allow or deny), protocol (TCP, UDP, or any), source and destination (IP addresses, service tags, or application security groups), and port ranges. Default rules provide baseline connectivity while custom rules implement specific security requirements.

**Example:** An NSG protecting web servers might allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from any source while restricting SSH (port 22) access to specific administrative IP addresses and blocking all other inbound traffic.

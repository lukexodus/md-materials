# Operations

### Redirection Using `>` and `>>`

Redirection using the `>` symbol is a way to redirect the output of a command to a file instead of displaying it on the terminal. The `>` symbol is used for output redirection, and it creates or overwrites the specified file with the output of the command.

1. **Syntax**:
    - `command > file`: Redirects the output of `command` to `file`, creating the file if it does not exist or overwriting its contents if it does.
    - If we ever need to actually truncate a file (or create a new, empty file), we can use a trick like this:
		`> ls-output.txt`
2. **Examples**:
    - `ls > filelist.txt`: Redirects the output of the `ls` command (list directory contents) to a file named `filelist.txt`. If `filelist.txt` does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, its contents are overwritten with the output of `ls`.
    - `echo "Hello, world!" > greeting.txt`: Redirects the output of the `echo` command (prints a string) to a file named `greeting.txt`. If `greeting.txt` does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, its contents are overwritten with the output of `echo`.
3. **Appending Output**:
    - If you want to append the output of a command to an existing file without overwriting its contents, you can use the `>>` symbol instead of `>`.
    - Example: `echo "Additional text" >> greeting.txt` appends the string "Additional text" to the end of the `greeting.txt` file without deleting its existing contents.
4. **Error Redirection**:
    - By default, the `>` symbol only redirects standard output (stdout). To **redirect standard error (stderr)** to a file, you can use the `2>` symbol.
    - Example: `command 2> error.log` redirects any error messages generated by `command` to a file named `error.log`.


***

A lot of people will try the following when they are learning about pipelines, “just to see what happens”:

```shell
command1 > command2
```

Answer: sometimes something really bad.

Here is an actual example submitted by a reader who was administering a Linux-based server appliance. As the superuser, he did this:

```shell
cd /usr/bin
ls > less
```

The first command put him in the directory where most programs are stored, and the second command told the shell to overwrite the file less with the output of the ls command. Since the /usr/bin directory already contained a file named less (the less program), the second command overwrote the less program file with the text from ls, thus destroying the less program on his system. 

The lesson here is that the redirection operator silently creates or overwrites files, so you need to treat it with a lot of respect.

### Redirecting `stdin` and `stdout` to the Same Target
  
To redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the same target, you can use the following syntax in Unix-like operating systems:

`command > file 2>&1`

- `command`: Represents the command whose output and error messages you want to redirect.
- `>`: Redirects the standard output of the command to the specified file.
- `file`: Represents the target file where you want to redirect the output and error messages.
- `2>&1`: Redirects standard error (file descriptor 2) to the same location as standard output (file descriptor 1).

By combining `2>&1`, you are telling the shell to send standard error to the same place as standard output, which in this case is the specified file.

**The Order is Important**

The redirection of standard error must always occur after redirecting standard output or it doesn’t work. The following example redirects standard error to the file ls-output.txt:

`> ls-output.txt 2>&1`

If the order is changed to the following, then standard error is directed to the screen:

`2>&1 >ls-output.txt`

**Shorthand Notation**

You can use `&>` as a shorthand notation to redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the same target, typically a file.

`command &> file`

Here's what each part of the command does:

- `command`: Represents the command whose output and error messages you want to redirect.
- `&>`: Redirects both standard output and standard error to the specified file.
- `file`: Represents the target file where you want to redirect the output and error messages.

With `&>`, you don't need to explicitly specify the redirection for standard error using `2>&1` as in the previous method. The `&>` notation combines both redirections into a single operation.

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the pipe character `|`. It allows the output of one command to be used as the input to another command, enabling powerful and flexible data processing and manipulation.

1. **Syntax**:
    - The basic syntax for a pipeline is:
        `command1 | command2 | command3 | ... | commandN`
        
    - Each command in the pipeline takes input from the previous command's output, except for the first command, which typically receives input from a file, a stream, or another source.
2. **Data Flow**:
    - Each command in the pipeline processes the data it receives from the previous command and produces output that becomes the input for the next command in the pipeline.
    - This data flow is seamless and efficient, as the commands run concurrently, and the data is passed between them through an internal mechanism provided by the operating system.
3. **Inter-Process Communication**:
    - Pipelines facilitate inter-process communication, allowing different commands or processes to collaborate and work together to achieve complex tasks.
    - Each command in the pipeline operates independently of the others, and the data flow between commands is managed transparently by the operating system.
4. **Example Usage**:
    - Counting the number of lines in a text file:
        `cat file.txt | wc -l`
        
    - Filtering lines containing a specific pattern:
        `grep "pattern" file.txt | wc -l`
        
    - Sorting the output of a command:
        `ls -l | sort -r`
        
5. **Composition**:
    - Pipelines can be composed of any number of commands, allowing for the creation of complex data processing workflows.
    - Each command in the pipeline performs a specific task, and the combined effect of all commands achieves the desired outcome.
6. **Efficiency**:
    - Pipelines are highly efficient, as they enable data processing to be distributed across multiple commands, leveraging the parallelism and concurrency capabilities of modern operating systems.


### `>` vs `|`

- `>` is used for output redirection, directing command output to a file.
- `|` is used to create pipelines, enabling the chaining of multiple commands together, with the output of one command serving as the input for the next command.

### Expansion

#### Expansion

Expansion in shell refers to the process of interpreting and expanding certain constructs or expressions into their corresponding values or representations before executing commands. Shell expansion is a fundamental feature of Unix-like shells, including Bash, Zsh, and others, and it plays a crucial role in command-line interpretation and execution.

1. **Variable Expansion**:
    - Variables in shell scripts are expanded to their assigned values when referenced using the `$` symbol.
    - Example: `echo $HOME` expands to the value of the `HOME` environment variable.
2. **Command Substitution**:
    - Command substitution allows the output of a command or sequence of commands to replace the command itself.
    - Syntax: `$(command)` or `` `command` ``
    - Example:
```shell
echo "Today is $(date)"
Today is Fri Feb  9 12:54:41 CST 2024

ls -l $(which cp)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 71516 2007-12-05 08:58 /bin/cp

file $(ls -d /usr/bin/* | grep zip)
/usr/bin/bunzip2: symbolic link to `bzip2'
/usr/bin/bzip2: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1
(SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, stripped
/usr/bin/gunzip: symbolic link to `../../bin/gunzip'
```
3. **Arithmetic Expansion**:
    - Arithmetic expressions enclosed within `$((...))` are evaluated and replaced with their numeric result.
    - Example: `echo $((2 + 3))` expands to `5`.
4. **Brace Expansion**:
    - Brace expansion generates arbitrary strings by expanding comma-separated sequences and ranges enclosed within `{...}`.
    - Example:
```shell
echo file{1..3}.txt
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

echo Front-{A,B,C}-Back
Front-A-Back Front-B-Back Front-C-Back

echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b
aA1b aA2b aB3b aB4b

echo {001..15}
001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 010 011 012 013 014 015

mkdir {2007..2009}-{01..12}
```

5. **Tilde Expansion**:
    - Tilde expansion replaces `~` with the path to the user's home directory.
    - Example: `ls ~` lists the contents of the user's home directory.
6. **Parameter Expansion**:
    - Parameter expansion performs transformations and substitutions on shell parameters and variables.
    - Example: `${var:-default}` expands to the value of `var` if it is set, otherwise it expands to `default`.
7. **Filename Expansion (Globbing)**:
    - Filename expansion, also known as globbing, expands wildcard patterns into a list of filenames matching the pattern.
    - Example: `ls *.txt` lists all files with the `.txt` extension in the current directory.
8. **Parameter Length Expansion**:
    - Parameter length expansion allows you to determine the length of a parameter or variable.
    - Syntax: `${#parameter}`
    - Example: `${#var}` returns the length of the variable `var`.
9. **Substring Expansion**:
    - Substring expansion extracts a portion of a string or variable.
    - Syntax: `${parameter:start:length}`
    - Example: `${var:0:3}` returns the first 3 characters of the variable `var`.
10. **Process Substitution**:
    - Process substitution allows you to use the output of a command as a file or input source in another command.
    - Syntax: `<(command)` or `>(command)`
    - Example: `diff <(command1) <(command2)` compares the output of `command1` and `command2`.

#### Arithmetic Expansion vs Evaluation
  
The `$((...))` and `((...))` constructs are both used for arithmetic operations in shell scripting, but they serve slightly different purposes:

1. **`$((...))`**: This construct is used for arithmetic expansion, where the result of the arithmetic expression enclosed within `$((...))` is substituted into the command or assignment. It is used in contexts where you need the result of the arithmetic operation as a value.
    
    Example:
```shell
result=$(( 10 + 5 ))
echo $result   # Output: 15
```
    
2. **`((...))`**: This construct is used for arithmetic evaluation and does not require the use of the dollar sign `$`. It evaluates the arithmetic expression within `((...))` and returns an exit status of 0 if the expression evaluates to a non-zero value, and 1 if it evaluates to zero. It is typically used in conditional statements and arithmetic comparisons.
    
    Example:
    
```shell
if (( 10 > 5 )); then
    echo "10 is greater than 5"
fi
```

#### Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition (+)**
2. **Subtraction (-)**
3. **Multiplication (*)**
4. **Division (/)**
5. **Modulus (%)**
6. **Increment (++) and Decrement (--)**
7. **Exponentiation (\*\*)

### Word Splitting

Word splitting is a process in shell scripting where the shell breaks up a string or command into separate words or tokens based on certain delimiters. The primary purpose of word splitting is to interpret and process commands, filenames, and arguments correctly. In shell scripts, word splitting occurs after expansion and before the execution of commands.

The default delimiters for word splitting are whitespace characters (spaces and tabs), but they can be customized using the value of the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) environment variable.

1. **Default Word Splitting**:
    - By default, the shell splits strings into words based on whitespace characters (spaces and tabs).
    - For example:
```shell
string="Hello World"
echo $string   # Output: Hello World
```
- Here, the `echo` command receives two separate arguments: "Hello" and "World".
2. **Custom Word Splitting with `IFS`**:
    - The `IFS` environment variable determines the characters used for word splitting.
    - You can customize `IFS` to split strings based on specific characters.
    - For example:
```shell
IFS=:
string="one:two:three" 
echo $string   # Output: one two three`
```
- Here, `IFS` is set to ":" (colon), so the shell splits the string at each colon.
3. **Quoting to Prevent Word Splitting**:
    - You can use quoting to prevent word splitting for specific strings or variables.
    - Single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are commonly used for this purpose.
    - For example:
```shell
string="Hello  World"
echo $string   # Output: Hello World
echo "$string" # Output: Hello  World
```
- Here, double quotes prevent word splitting, and the entire string is treated as a single argument.

### Suppressing Expansions

In shell scripting, single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are used to control expansions differently:

1. **Single Quotes (`'`)**:
    - When enclosing a string in single quotes, all characters within the quotes are treated literally.
    - No expansions or substitutions are performed within single quotes.
    - Single quotes suppress all forms of expansions, including variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
    - For example:
```shell
echo 'text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER'
text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER
```
        
2. **Double Quotes (`"`)**
    - When enclosing a string in double quotes, most characters are treated literally, except for a few special characters like `$`, `\`, and `` ` ``.
    - Variable expansion and command substitution are performed within double quotes, but not within single quotes.
    - Double quotes allow selective suppression of expansions while still allowing certain substitutions.
    - For example:
```shell
echo "text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER"
text ~/*.txt {a,b} foo 4 me
```

### Escaping Characters
  
The use of the backslash () as an escape character is common in shell scripting to selectively prevent expansions or to include special characters in strings or filenames.

1. **Preventing Expansion in Double Quotes**:
    - Inside double quotes (`"`), the backslash is used to escape special characters that would otherwise trigger expansions.
    - For example:
        `echo "The balance for user $USER is: \$5.00"`
        
    - Output: `The balance for user me is: $5.00`
    - Here, the backslash `\` before `$` prevents the expansion of the variable `$USER`.
2. **Including Special Characters in Filenames**:
    - To include special characters like `$`, `!`, `&`, spaces, and others in filenames, you can use the backslash to escape them.
    - For example:
        `mv bad\&filename good_filename`
        
    - This command renames the file `bad&filename` to `good_filename`.
    - The backslash `\` before `&` prevents the shell from interpreting `&` as a special character.
3. **Escaping Backslash Itself**:
    
    - To include a literal backslash character in a string or filename, you need to escape it with another backslash.
    - For example:
        `echo "This is a backslash: \\"`
        
    - Output: `This is a backslash: \`
    - The double backslash `\\` represents a single literal backslash character.
4. **Backslash in Single Quotes**:
    - Within single quotes (`'`), the backslash loses its special meaning and is treated as an ordinary character.
    - Special characters within single quotes are treated literally, without any interpretation or expansion.
    - For example:
        `echo 'This is a backslash: \\'`
        
    - Output: `This is a backslash: \\`
    - The backslash is treated as a literal character within single quotes and does not escape anything.

### Escape Sequences

1. **`\n`**: Represents a newline character.`
2. **`\t`**: Represents a tab character.
3. **`\r`**: Represents a carriage return character.
4. **`\v`**: Represents a vertical tab character.`
5. **`\a`**: Represents an alert (bell) character.
6. **`\f`**: Represents a form feed character.`
7. **`\\`**: Represents a single backslash character.`
8. **`\"`**: Represents a double quote character.`
9. **`\'`**: Represents a single quote character.`

10. **Using the `-e` option**:
    - The `-e` option enables the interpretation of escape sequences in the string provided to `echo`.
    - Example: `sleep 10; echo -e "Time's up\a"`
11. **Using `$' '` syntax**:
    - Escape sequences can also be included inside the `$' '` syntax to achieve the same effect.
    - Example: `sleep 10; echo "Time's up" $'\a'`

### Command Line Editing

**Basic Cursor Movement:**

- **Ctrl-A**: Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
- **Ctrl-E**: Move cursor to the end of the line.
- **Ctrl-F**: Move cursor forward one character (same as the right arrow key).
- **Ctrl-B**: Move cursor backward one character (same as the left arrow key).

**Word-level Cursor Movement:**

- **Alt-F**: Move cursor forward one word.
- **Alt-B**: Move cursor backward one word.

**Line Editing:**

- **Ctrl-D**: Deletes the character under the cursor.
- **Ctrl-T**: Transpose (exchange) the character at the cursor location with the one preceding it.
- **Alt-T**: Transpose the word at the cursor location with the one preceding it.
- **Alt-U**: Converts the characters from the cursor to the end of the word to uppercase.
- **Alt-L**: Converts the characters from the cursor to the end of the word to lowercase.
- **Alt-C**: Capitalizes the character under the cursor and moves to the end of the word.

- **Ctrl-U**: Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the beginning of the line, clears the entire line.
- **Ctrl-K**: Clears the line after the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, does nothing.
- **Alt-D or Esc-D**: Deletes the word after the cursor.
- **Ctrl-W** or **Alt-Backspace**: Deletes the word before the cursor.
- **Ctrl-Y**: Pastes the last deleted text or word.

**Screen Clearing and History:**

- **Ctrl-L**: Clear the screen and move the cursor to the top-left corner. The `clear` command does the same thing.
- **Ctrl-R**: Begins a reverse search through command history.

**Cancellation and Interruption:**

- **Ctrl-C**: Cancels the current command line input or stops the currently running command.

### Tab Completion

Completion using the TAB key helps users quickly and efficiently complete commands, filenames, paths, variables, and other entities in the terminal environment. When you press the TAB key, the system attempts to complete the input based on the context of your command or the contents of the current directory.

1. **Command Completion:**
    - Typing a partial command and pressing TAB will attempt to complete the command based on available commands in your system's PATH.
    - Example: Typing `ls` and pressing TAB might complete it to `lsblk`.
2. **Filename Completion:**
    - When typing a filename or path, pressing TAB will attempt to complete the filename or directory.
    - Example: Typing `cd /ho` and pressing TAB might complete it to `cd /home/`.
3. **Variable Completion:**
    - In shell scripts or when working with variables, pressing TAB after typing a partial variable name will attempt to complete the variable name.
    - Example: Typing `$HOME/Doc` and pressing TAB might complete it to `$HOME/Documents/`.
4. **Options and Arguments Completion:**
    - Pressing TAB after typing a command followed by a space will attempt to complete options and arguments for that command.
    - Example: Typing `ls -` and pressing TAB might display available options such as `-a`, `-l`, etc.
5. **Directory and Path Completion:**
    - TAB completion can also complete directory names and paths, making navigation easier.
    - Example: Typing `cd /usr/lo` and pressing TAB might complete it to `cd /usr/local/`.
6. **Multiple Options and Ambiguities:**
    - If there are multiple possible completions, pressing TAB twice will display a list of available options.
    - Example: Typing `ls /b` and pressing TAB twice might display options like `/bin/` and `/boot/`.

### History Commands

- **Ctrl-P**: Move to the previous history entry. Same as pressing the up arrow key.
- **Ctrl-N**: Move to the next history entry. Same as pressing the down arrow key.
- **Alt-<**: Move to the beginning (top) of the history list.
- **Alt->**: Move to the end (bottom) of the history list, i.e., the current command line.
- **Ctrl-R**: Reverse incremental search. Searches incrementally from the current command line up the history list.
	- To find the next occurrence of the text (moving “up” the history list), press **Ctrl-R** again. To quit searching, press either **Ctrl-G** or **Ctrl-C**.
	- We can copy the command to our current command line for further editing by pressing **Ctrl-J**.
- **Alt-P**: Reverse search, non-incremental. Type in the search string and press Enter before the search is performed.
- **Alt-N**: Forward search, non-incremental.
- **Ctrl-O**: Execute the current item in the history list and advance to the next one. Handy for re-executing a sequence of commands in the history list.

### History Expansion

History expansion is a feature in Unix-like shells that allows you to recall and reuse commands from your command history. It enables you to access previously executed commands and manipulate them in various ways before executing them again.

1. **Using the Exclamation Mark (!)**:
    - The exclamation mark (!) is used to initiate history expansion.
    - You can recall commands from your history by specifying their history number, or by searching for a command using a pattern.
    - For example:
        - `!n`: Executes the command with the history number `n`.
        - `!-n`: Executes the command that is `n` lines back in the history.
        - `!string`: Executes the most recent command that starts with `string`.
2. **Substitution**:
    - You can use history expansion to perform substitution within commands.
    - For example:
        - `!$`: Refers to the last argument of the previous command.
        - `!:n`: Refers to the nth argument of the previous command.
        - `!string:s/search/replace/`: Repeats the last command that starts with `string`, replacing `search` with `replace`.
3. **Modifiers**:
    - Modifiers allow you to modify the output of history expansion.
    - For example:
        - `!n:p`: Prints the command without executing it.
        - `!n:gs/old/new/`: Repeats command `n`, globally substituting `old` with `new`.
        - `!-n:q`: Quotes the substituted words, preventing further expansion.
4. **Event Designators**:
    - Event designators are special characters used to refer to commands in history.
    - For example:
        - `!!`: Repeats the last command.
        - `!$`: Refers to the last argument of the previous command.
        - `!*`: Refers to all arguments of the previous command.

**History expansion** in Linux Bash is a feature that allows you to reuse commands or parts of commands from your command history quickly, without retyping them. It is most often triggered by the exclamation mark `!` and is enabled by default in interactive shells.

Key points about history expansion:

- The shell replaces strings starting with `!` with commands or arguments from the history list immediately after you press Enter, before executing the command.
- Common history expansion syntax includes:
  - `!!` — repeats the last executed command.
  - `!N` — refers to the Nth command in the history.
  - `!-N` — refers to the command N before the current one.
  - `!string` — repeats the last command starting with `string`.
  - `!?string?` — repeats the last command containing `string`.
  - `!$` — refers to the last argument of the previous command.
  - `!*` — refers to all arguments of the previous command.
- You can also use modifiers and word designators to extract parts of commands or perform replacements.
- To avoid accidental execution of expanded commands, you can preview expansions with `history -p`.
- History expansion can be disabled with `set +H` and enabled with `set -H`.
- History expansions happen before the shell parses the command, making it a powerful tool for quick command recall and editing.

Example usage:
```bash
$ echo Hello World
Hello World
$ !!
echo Hello World
Hello World
$ !ec
echo Hello World
Hello World
$ !echo:0
echo
$ !echo:1
Hello
$ ^World^Bash
echo Hello Bash  # This replaces "World" with "Bash" in the previous command and runs it
```

This feature greatly speeds up command-line usage by allowing quick reuse and modification of previous commands without retyping them fully.


### Signals

Signals in Unix-like operating systems are software interrupts that are used to communicate with processes and manage their behavior. They are a fundamental mechanism for process management, allowing the operating system and other processes to interact with running programs. 

1. **Signal Types**:
    - **Standard Signals**: These are signals with numbers between 1 and 31, which have predefined meanings and behaviors. Examples include `SIGINT` (2), `SIGTERM` (15), and `SIGKILL` (9).
    - **Real-time Signals**: These signals have numbers from 32 to 63 and are used for real-time applications. Examples include `SIGRTMIN` (32) and `SIGRTMAX` (64).
2. **Common Signals**:
    - `SIGINT` (2): Sent by the terminal interrupt character (Ctrl+C) to request the process to terminate.
    - `SIGTERM` (15): Sent by the `kill` command to request the process to terminate gracefully.
    - `SIGKILL` (9): Sent by the `kill` command to force the process to terminate immediately.
	    - Whereas programs may choose to handle signals sent to them in different ways, including ignoring them all together, the KILL signal is never actually sent to the target program. Rather, the kernel immediately terminates the process. When a process is terminated in this manner, it is given no opportunity to “clean up” after itself or save its work. For this reason, the KILL signal should be used only as a last resort when other termination signals fail.
    - `SIGHUP` (1): Sent when a terminal session is disconnected or closed.
	    - This signal is also used by many daemon programs to cause a reinitialization. This means that when a daemon is sent this signal, it will restart and reread its configuration file. The Apache web server is an example of a daemon that uses the HUP signal in this way.
    - `SIGSTOP` (19): Used to pause a process.
    - `SIGCONT` (18): Used to continue/restore a process after a STOP or TSTP signal. This signal is sent by the `bg` and `fg` commands.
    - `SIGUSR1` (10) and `SIGUSR2` (12): User-defined signals that can be used for application-specific purposes.
3. **Signal Handling**:
    - **Default Action**: Each signal has a default action associated with it, such as terminating the process (`SIGTERM`) or ignoring the signal (`SIGCHLD`).
    - **Signal Handlers**: Processes can install signal handlers, which are functions that are executed in response to receiving a signal. Signal handlers allow processes to customize their response to signals.
    - **Ignoring or Blocking Signals**: Processes can choose to ignore certain signals or block them temporarily to prevent them from being delivered while performing critical operations.
4. **Sending Signals**:
    - Signals can be sent to processes using the `kill` command or programmatically using system calls like `kill()` in C. 
    - Signals may be specified either by number or by name, including the name prefixed with the letters SIG.
    - The `kill` command allows users to send signals to processes by specifying the process ID (PID) or the process group ID (PGID).
    - Processes, like files, have owners, and you must be the owner of a process (or the superuser) to send it signals with kill.

#### `sigtstp` vs `sigstop`

`SIGTSTP` and `SIGSTOP` are both signals used to stop or suspend processes in Unix-like operating systems, but they have different behaviors:

1. **SIGTSTP (Signal Number 20)**:
   - Name: Terminal Stop
   - Effect: This signal is typically generated by the terminal driver when the user presses `Ctrl + Z`.
   - Action: It suspends the process, causing it to stop its execution and be placed in the background. The process can be resumed later using the `fg` or `bg` commands.
   - Use: Often used to temporarily pause a process and move it to the background.

2. **SIGSTOP (Signal Number 19)**:
   - Name: Stop
   - Effect: This signal immediately stops the process without any exceptions.
   - Action: Unlike SIGTSTP, SIGSTOP cannot be caught or ignored by the process. It forces the process to halt its execution immediately.
   - Use: Commonly used by system administrators to halt critical processes or troubleshoot issues.


### Job Control

In Linux Bash, **job control** is the ability to manage multiple processes (jobs) within a single shell session, typically allowing you to stop (suspend), resume, background, or foreground those processes interactively.

**Key Concepts of Job Control**

- A **job** is a pipeline of one or more processes started by the shell.
- Each job is assigned a **job number** (starting from 1) by the shell.
- Jobs can be in one of several states:
  - Running in the foreground (actively interacting with the terminal)
  - Running in the background
  - Stopped (suspended) via signals such as Ctrl+Z or a stop signal
- The shell manages a table of jobs, each identified by a job number and process group ID.

**Common Job Control Commands**

- `jobs`: Lists all current jobs with their status.
  - `jobs -l` shows job details including process IDs (PIDs).
  - `jobs -r` shows only running jobs.
  - `jobs -s` shows only stopped jobs.

- `fg %[job_number]`: Brings a background or stopped job to the foreground.
  
- `bg %[job_number]`: Resumes a stopped job in the background.

- `kill %[job_number]` or `kill [PID]`: Sends a signal to the job or process (commonly to terminate a job).

**Job Control Signals**

- `Ctrl+Z`: Sends `SIGTSTP` to a foreground process, suspending it.
- `Ctrl+C`: Sends `SIGINT` to terminate a foreground process.
- `SIGCONT`: Used internally to resume a stopped process.
- `SIGSTOP`: Forces stopping a process and cannot be ignored.

**Usage Example**

```bash
# Start a job in background
sleep 100 &

# List jobs
jobs

# Suspend a foreground job (Ctrl+Z)

# Resume the last suspended job in background
bg

# Bring the job to foreground
fg
```

**Job Specification**

Jobs can be referred to by the `%` symbol followed by the job number, e.g., `%1`. You can also refer to jobs by command prefix, like `%vim`, or by substring `%?string`.

***

Job control in Bash is built upon process groups and signals, which coordinate the management of jobs and terminals. This mechanism allows flexible handling of running commands, especially useful for multitasking in a command-line environment.

#### Putting a Process on the Background

Putting a process in the background allows it to run independently of the current shell session, freeing up the terminal for other tasks or commands. Here's how to put a process in the background:

1. **Start a Process in the Background:**
   - To start a process in the background, you can append an ampersand `&` to the end of the command.
   - For example:
     ```
     command &
     ```

2. **Example:**
   - Suppose you want to start a long-running process, such as a file compression task:
     ```
     compress_large_file &
     ```
   - The `compress_large_file` process will start executing in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal for other tasks.

3. **Managing Background Processes:**
   - After starting a process in the background, the shell displays the process ID (PID) and continues to accept new commands.
   - You can monitor background processes using utilities like `top`, `ps`, or `jobs` (if the process is started from the same shell session).
```shell
$ xlogo &
[1] 28236
```
- This message is part of a shell feature called job control. With this message, the shell is telling us that we have started job number 1 ([1]) and that it has PID 28236.
```shell
$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
10603 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
28236 pts/1    00:00:00 xlogo
28239 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
```

```shell
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 xlogo &
```

4. **Foreground vs. Background:**
   - When a process runs in the foreground, it occupies the terminal and interacts directly with the user.
   - In contrast, a background process runs independently of the terminal and does not require user interaction.

5. **Exiting the Shell:**
   - If you exit the shell before a background process completes, the process will continue running.
   - However, the process will be terminated if it relies on the terminal for input/output and the terminal is closed.

6. **Bringing a Background Process to the Foreground:**
   - If needed, you can bring a background process to the foreground by using the `fg` command followed by the job ID (called a jobspec) or PID. The jobspec is optional if there is only one job.
   - For example:
     ```
     fg %1
     ```
     This brings the job with ID 1 to the foreground.

Putting processes in the background is useful for running long-running tasks or scripts without tying up the terminal. It allows users to continue working while tasks execute in the background.

#### Terminating or Suspending a Process

`Ctrl + C` is used to terminate a process, while `Ctrl + Z` is used to pause a process and move it to the background temporarily. 

1. **Ctrl + C (`SIGINT` signal)**:
   - Effect: Sends the `SIGINT` signal to the foreground process, typically resulting in its termination.
   - Use: Used to interrupt or terminate a process abruptly.
   - Action: The process receives the `SIGINT` signal, which by default terminates the process. It's often used to cancel or stop a running command.

2. **Ctrl + Z (`SIGTSTP` signal)**:
   - Effect: Sends the `SIGTSTP` signal to the foreground process, causing it to suspend or pause its execution.
   - Use: Used to pause a process and put it in the background temporarily.
   - Action: The process is stopped and placed in the background. It remains in a suspended state until resumed or terminated.
   - We can either continue the program’s execution in the foreground, using the `fg` command, or resume the program’s execution in the background with the `bg` command.

### Error Handling

In Linux Bash scripting, **error handling** refers to techniques and practices used to detect, respond to, and recover from errors that occur during script execution. Since Bash does not have built-in try-catch exceptions like other languages, error handling relies on checking command exit statuses and using built-in shell features.

Here are some **key methods and best practices for error handling in Bash scripts**:

#### 1. Exit Status Checking
- Every command returns an exit status (`$?`) where `0` means success and any non-zero value indicates failure.
- You can check this after critical commands:
  ```bash
  command
  if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "Command failed"
    exit 1
  fi
  ```
- Or use a compact form with `||` (OR operator):
  ```bash
  command || { echo "Command failed"; exit 1; }
  ```

#### 2. Using `set -e` (Exit on Error)
- `set -e` causes the script to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero status.
- Useful for scripts where any error should stop further execution.
- Combine with other options like `set -u` (error on unset variables) and `set -o pipefail` (fail if any component in a pipeline fails).

#### 3. `trap` for Error Handling
- You can define custom error handling functions and use the `trap` command to catch errors and signals.
- Example:
  ```bash
  handle_error() {
    echo "Error occurred in command: $BASH_COMMAND"
    exit 1
  }
  trap 'handle_error' ERR
  ```
- The `trap` on `ERR` will execute the handler on any failed command.

#### 4. Implementing Try-Catch-like Structures
- Bash lacks native try-catch, but you can simulate it using functions and `trap`.
- Example:
  ```bash
  handle_error() {
    echo "Error occurred: $?"
    exit 1
  }
  trap handle_error ERR

  try() {
    # commands that might fail
  }
  try
  ```
- This structure allows centralized error logging or cleanup.

#### 5. Logging Errors
- Inside the error handler, log messages and command context can be written to a log file for later debugging.
- Example:
  ```bash
  handle_error() {
    echo "[$(date)] Error in command: $BASH_COMMAND" >> error.log
    exit 1
  }
  trap handle_error ERR
  ```

#### 6. Retry Mechanism
- For commands prone to transient failures (network, I/O), retry loops can be implemented:
  ```bash
  retry_command() {
    local n=1
    local max=5
    local delay=2
    while true; do
      "$@" && break || {
        if [[ $n -lt $max ]]; then
          ((n++))
          echo "Attempt $n/$max failed. Retrying in $delay seconds..."
          sleep $delay
        else
          echo "Command failed after $n attempts."
          return 1
        fi
      }
    done
  }
  retry_command some_command
  ```

#### Checking the Exit Code

To determine the exit code of a program in Linux, you can use the special shell variable `$?` immediately after running the command. This variable holds the exit status of the last executed command or program. Here is how you can do it:

1. Run your program or command.
2. Immediately after the command finishes, check the exit code by running:
   ```
   echo $?
   ```
3. The output will be a number between 0 and 255:
   - `0` indicates successful execution.
   - Any other number indicates an error or a specific condition.

For example:
```bash
ls /some/directory
echo $?
```
If the `ls` command runs successfully, `echo $?` will output `0`. If the directory does not exist or there's an error, it will output a non-zero exit code.

In shell scripts, you can also check the exit code programmatically:
```bash
command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Command succeeded"
else
  echo "Command failed with exit code $?"
fi
```

Or more concisely within an if statement without directly using `$?`:
```bash
if command; then
  echo "Command succeeded"
else
  echo "Command failed"
fi
```

Exit codes typically range from 0 (success) to 255 (various errors). Some exit codes are reserved by the shell for internal use (e.g., 124 to 127). If a command is terminated by a signal, the exit code is 128 plus the signal number.

So, the primary way to determine the exit code of a program in Linux is to check `$?` right after running the command. This method applies to interactive command line use and within shell scripts.


## Permission Formats

Linux file permissions can be represented in several formats that help to understand and manage access control. The main permission formats are:

### 1. Symbolic Notation (Text format)
- Permissions are shown as a string of characters like `-rwxr-xr--`.
- The first character indicates the file type:
  - `-` for regular file
  - `d` for directory
  - `l` for symbolic link, etc.
- The next nine characters are grouped into three sets of three:
  - User (owner) permissions: `rwx` (read, write, execute)
  - Group permissions: `r-x`
  - Others (world) permissions: `r--`
- Characters meanings:
  - `r` = read permission
  - `w` = write permission
  - `x` = execute permission
  - `-` = no permission
- Additional letters like `s` or `t` may appear for special permissions like SUID, SGID, and sticky bit.

Example: `-rwxr-xr--` means owner can read, write, execute; group can read and execute; others can read only.

***

### 2. Octal (Numeric) Notation
- Uses numbers to represent permissions.
- Each permission type is assigned a numeric value:
  - Read = 4
  - Write = 2
  - Execute = 1
- For each of user, group, and others, sum the values for granted permissions.
- Permissions are written as three digits (or four, if special bits included), e.g., `755`.
- The digits represent user, group, and others respectively.

Example:
- `7` (4+2+1) = read, write, execute
- `5` (4+0+1) = read, execute
- `4` = read only

So `755` means user has `rwx`, group has `r-x`, others have `r-x`.

***

### 3. Special Permissions in Numeric Notation (4-digit)
- The first digit denotes special permissions:
  - 4 = SUID
  - 2 = SGID
  - 1 = Sticky bit
- The next three digits represent normal permissions for user, group, and others.

Example:
- `4755` means SUID bit set + normal permissions `755`.

***

### 4. Symbolic Mode for Changing Permissions
- Used with `chmod` commands.
- Format is `[ugoa][+-=][rwx]`
  - `u` = user, `g` = group, `o` = others, `a` = all
  - `+` adds permission, `-` removes permission, `=` sets exact permission
- Examples:
  - `chmod u+x file` adds execute permission to the user.
  - `chmod go-w file` removes write permission from group and others.
  - `chmod a=r file` sets read-only permission for all.

"others" refers to all users who are not the owner of the file and are not members of the group that owns the file.

***

### Summary Table of Formats

| Format            | Example           | Explanation                                |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Symbolic notation | `-rwxr-xr--`      | Read, write, execute for owner; r-x for group; r for others |
| Octal notation    | `755`             | Numeric summation of permissions per user/group/others |
| Special bits + Octal | `4755`           | SUID + normal permissions                   |
| Symbolic chmod    | `u+x`, `go-w`     | Modifying permissions using descriptive letters and symbols |

These permission formats are fundamental for Linux file security and system administration, allowing clear control over who can read, write, or execute files and directories.

# Concepts

### Root User vs Non-root User

In Linux, there is a significant difference between using the **root user** and a **non-root user**, primarily in terms of **permissions**, **security**, and **system administration**. Here’s an overview:

---

**Root User**

The **root user** is the system's superuser and has unrestricted access to all files, commands, and resources on the system. It is intended for administrative tasks.

**Characteristics of Root User:**

1. **Full Permissions**:
    - The root user can read, write, and execute any file or command, even those that other users are restricted from accessing.
2. **System Administration**:
    - Tasks such as installing or updating software, configuring system-wide settings, managing other users, and modifying system files (e.g., `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`) require root privileges.
3. **Command Prompt**:
    - The prompt for the root user typically ends with a `#` (e.g., `root@hostname:#`), distinguishing it from non-root users whose prompt ends with `$`.
4. **Security Risks**:
    - Since the root user has unrestricted permissions, any mistakes (like deleting system files or misconfiguring critical services) can severely harm the system.
    - Unauthorized access to the root account can compromise the entire system.
5. **Examples of Tasks Requiring Root**:
    - Modifying system files: `vim /etc/hostname`
    - Managing services: `systemctl restart nginx`
    - Installing software: `dnf install apache2`
    - Creating new users: `useradd john`

---

**Non-Root Users**

Non-root users are regular users with limited privileges, intended for everyday use. They are restricted from performing administrative or system-critical tasks unless explicitly granted permissions.

**Characteristics of Non-Root Users:**

1. **Limited Permissions**:
    
    - Non-root users can only modify files they own or have been given permission to access.
    - They cannot install software, manage services, or modify system files.
2. **Security**:
    
    - Non-root users are safer for daily tasks because they limit the risk of accidentally harming the system.
    - If a non-root user’s account is compromised, the damage is limited to that user’s files and processes.
3. **Command Prompt**:
    
    - The prompt for non-root users usually ends with a `$` (e.g., `username@hostname:$`).
4. **Examples of Tasks Performed by Non-Root Users**:
    
    - Creating or editing files in their home directory (`~/`): `vim myfile.txt`
    - Running personal scripts or applications: `./myscript.sh`
    - Using software: `firefox`
    - Managing user-specific settings and preferences.

---

**Switching Between Root and Non-Root Users**

1. **Switching to Root User**:
    
    - You can switch to the root user using the `su` (substitute user) command:
        
        ```bash
        su -
        ```
        
        Enter the root password when prompted.
        
    - Alternatively, you can execute a command as root using `sudo`:
        
        ```bash
        sudo <command>
        ```
        
        This temporarily grants root privileges to a non-root user (if the user is authorized in `/etc/sudoers`).
        
2. **Switching to a Non-Root User**:
    
    - As the root user, you can switch to another user:
        
        ```bash
        su - <username>
        ```
        

---

**Advantages of Using Non-Root Users**

1. **Security**:
    - Non-root users limit the risk of accidental or intentional system-wide damage.
    - If a non-root account is compromised, the attacker’s access is limited to that user’s files and processes.
2. **Best Practice**:
    - For day-to-day activities like browsing, coding, or running applications, it is recommended to use a non-root user.
    - Only switch to root when necessary (e.g., for administrative tasks).

---

**Advantages of Using Root**

1. **Full System Control**:
    - The root user can perform any task without restrictions, making it essential for system administration and troubleshooting.
2. **Efficiency**:
    - Root privileges allow you to execute administrative commands without needing to prepend `sudo` or adjust permissions.

---

**Risks of Always Using Root**

1. **Accidental Mistakes**:
    - A simple command like `rm -rf /` can wipe the entire system if run as root.
    - Misconfigurations can lead to system instability or failure.
2. **Security Vulnerability**:
    - If you are logged in as root and leave your session open, it creates a significant security risk.
    - Malware or unauthorized users could exploit root privileges to harm the system.

---

**Best Practices**

1. **For Root**:
    - Only use the root account when absolutely necessary.
    - Use `sudo` for one-off administrative tasks instead of switching to the root user entirely.
    - Always log out of the root session when done.
2. **For Non-Root Users**:
    
    - Use a non-root account for day-to-day activities.
    - Grant specific permissions (via `sudo`) to non-root users if they need limited administrative access.

---

**Summary Table: Root vs. Non-Root Users**

|Feature|Root User|Non-Root User|
|---|---|---|
|**Permissions**|Full, unrestricted access|Limited to user-owned files/processes|
|**Prompt Symbol**|`#`|`$`|
|**Use Case**|System administration tasks|Day-to-day activities|
|**Security Risk**|High|Low|
|**Typical Commands**|Managing services, editing system files|Running apps, creating/editing personal files|

For maximum security and stability, use a non-root user for most activities and switch to root only when necessary.

### Login Shells vs Non-Login Shells

When working with the Bash shell in Linux, it's important to understand the distinction between **login shells** and **non-login shells**. Each type of shell has different behaviors and uses, which can affect how your environment is set up.

**Login Shells**

- **Definition**: A login shell is initiated when a user logs into the system. This can occur through a terminal login, SSH session, or when starting a terminal emulator that is configured to act as a login shell.
- **Characteristics**:
    - It reads specific configuration files to set up the environment. For Bash, this typically includes `/etc/profile` and `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, or `~/.profile` if the former files do not exist
- The shell is usually indicated by a dash in the process name (e.g., `-bash`), which signifies that it is a login shell
- **Use Cases**: Login shells are used to establish the user environment upon logging in, setting up environment variables, paths, and other configurations necessary for the user session.

**Non-Login Shells**

- **Definition**: A non-login shell is started without a user logging in. This typically occurs when you open a new terminal window or tab in a graphical environment.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Non-login shells read the `~/.bashrc` file for configuration settings, which is where you typically define aliases, functions, and shell options
    - They do not read the login-specific files like `.bash_profile` or `.profile`.
- **Use Cases**: Non-login shells are useful for interactive tasks where you want to use predefined commands and settings without needing to re-establish the entire environment.

**Key Differences**

- **Execution Context**: Login shells are for user login sessions, while non-login shells are for interactive sessions initiated after login.
- **Configuration Files**: Login shells read from files like `.bash_profile`, whereas non-login shells read from `.bashrc`.

Understanding these differences helps in configuring your shell environment effectively, ensuring that the right settings are applied in the appropriate contexts!

#### `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, and `.bashrc`

When working with the Bash shell in Linux, you may encounter several configuration files that help customize your shell environment. Here’s a breakdown of the three main files: **`.profile`**, **`.bash_profile`**, and **`.bashrc`**.

**1. .profile**

- **Purpose**: The `.profile` file is a shell script that is executed for login shells. It is used to set environment variables and execute commands that should run at the start of a user session.
- **Usage**: This file is typically used in systems where Bash is not the default shell. It can be used by other shells as well, making it a more universal option for setting up the environment.

**2. .bash_profile**

- **Purpose**: The `.bash_profile` file is specific to Bash and is executed when Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell. This means it runs when you log in to your system or start a new terminal session that requires a login.
- **Usage**: It is common to use `.bash_profile` to set environment variables and to source `.bashrc` to ensure that the configurations in `.bashrc` are also applied in login shells

**3. .bashrc**

- **Purpose**: The `.bashrc` file is executed for interactive non-login shells. This means it runs when you open a new terminal window or tab, but not when you log in.
- **Usage**: This file is typically used for setting shell options, aliases, and functions that you want available in every interactive shell session

**Key Differences**

- **Execution Context**:
    - `.bash_profile` is for login shells, while `.bashrc` is for non-login shells.
    - `.profile` can be used by various shells, while `.bash_profile` is specific to Bash.
- **Common Practice**: It is common to have `.bash_profile` source `.bashrc` to ensure that all configurations are loaded regardless of how the shell is started. This can be done by adding the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
    fi
```

By understanding these files, you can effectively customize your Bash environment to suit your needs!

### Inodes

Inodes, short for "index nodes," are data structures in Unix-like file systems that store metadata about files and directories. Each file and directory on a Unix-like file system is represented by an inode. Inodes contain information such as:

1. **File ownership**: The user and group associated with the file.
2. **File permissions**: The access permissions for the file (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.
3. **File size**: The size of the file in bytes.
4. **File timestamps**: The timestamps indicating when the file was created, last accessed, and last modified.
5. **File type**: Whether the inode represents a regular file, directory, symbolic link, device file, etc.
6. **File data location**: Pointers to the actual data blocks on the disk where the file's content is stored.

Inodes are crucial for the file system's management and operation. They allow the operating system to efficiently locate and manage files and directories on the disk. The number of inodes allocated to a file system at its creation determines the maximum number of files and directories that can be stored on that file system.

When a file system is created, a fixed number of inodes are allocated based on the file system's size and the expected number of files. If a file system runs out of available inodes, it cannot create additional files or directories, even if there is free space available on the disk.

Therefore, monitoring inode usage is important, especially on systems where a large number of small files or directories are expected. The `df -i` command displays inode usage statistics for each mounted file system, helping administrators assess inode utilization and plan storage accordingly.

### Hard Links

Hard links allow multiple directory entries (file names) to point to the same inode, which represents the data blocks of a file. Unlike symbolic links, which are separate files containing the path to the target file, hard links directly reference the inode of the target file.

1. **Same Inode**: Hard links share the same inode number as the original file. Each file name pointing to the same inode is considered a hard link to the file.
    
2. **Link Count**: The number of hard links to a file is stored as metadata in the inode. This link count is incremented each time a new hard link is created and decremented each time a hard link is deleted.
    
3. **Location**: Hard links can only exist within the same filesystem as the target file. They cannot cross filesystem boundaries.
    
4. **File Deletion**: When a file is deleted, its inode and data blocks are only released when the link count reaches zero. Deleting one hard link does not remove the file's contents as long as other hard links to the file exist.
    
5. **File Content**: All hard links to a file share the same content on disk. Changes made to one hard link are reflected in all other hard links to the same file because they all point to the same inode and data blocks.
    
6. **Creation**: Hard links can be created using the `ln` command without any options. For example:
    
    `ln /path/to/original /path/to/hardlink`
    
7. **Indication**: When listing files with `ls -l`, hard links display the number of hard links to the file in the second column

	The original file is essentially considered as a hard link itself. Files are represented by inodes, which contain metadata about the file and a reference to the actual data blocks on disk. When you create a hard link to a file, you're essentially creating a new directory entry (filename) that points to the same inode as the original file.
    
8. **Usage**: Hard links are commonly used for managing versions of files, and efficiently sharing data between multiple locations without duplicating disk space.

```shell
$ echo "Hello, world!" > original.txt
$ ln original.txt hardlink.txt`
```

In this example, `original.txt` and `hardlink.txt` are hard links to the same file. Both files share the same inode and data blocks, so any changes made to one file are reflected in the other file.

#### Copying Files vs Making Hard Links

1. **Copying Files**:
    - **Purpose**: Copying files creates new, independent copies of the original files.
    - **Implications**:
        - Each copy is a separate file with its own inode, metadata, and data blocks.
        - Changes made to one copy do not affect other copies.
        - Requires additional disk space proportional to the size of the copied files.
        - Suitable for creating backups, distributing files, and modifying files independently.
2. **Making Hard Links**:
    - **Purpose**: Creating hard links establishes multiple directory entries (filenames) that point to the same inode (file).
    - **Implications**:
        - All hard links to the same file share the same inode, metadata, and data blocks.
        - Changes made to one hard link are reflected in all other hard links since they all point to the same underlying data.
        - Does not consume additional disk space (except for directory entries).
        - Deleting any hard link does not immediately delete the file; the file is only removed when all hard links are deleted.
        - Suitable for creating multiple access points to the same data, maintaining versioning systems, and conserving disk space.

### Symblic Links

Symbolic links, also known as soft links, are special files in Unix-like operating systems that serve as pointers or references to other files or directories. They act as shortcuts, allowing users to create links to files or directories located anywhere in the filesystem.

1. **Type**: Symbolic links are files themselves, distinct from the target file or directory they point to.
    
2. **Structure**: Symbolic links contain the path to the target file or directory. This path can be absolute (starting from the root directory) or relative to the location of the symbolic link.
    
3. **Location**: Symbolic links can reside on the same filesystem as the target or on different filesystems.
    
4. **Creation**: Symbolic links can be created using the `ln -s` command. The `-s` option indicates that a symbolic link should be created. For example:
    
    `ln -s /path/to/target /path/to/symlink`
    
5. **Indication**: When listing files with `ls -l`, symbolic links are denoted by an "l" as the first character in the file permissions column.
	![[Pasted image 20240208093538.png]]
    
6. **Symbolic Link Resolution**: When a program accesses a symbolic link, the operating system resolves the link to its target file or directory and accesses the content of the target.
    
7. **Modification and Deletion**: Symbolic links can be easily modified or deleted without affecting the target file or directory. If the target of a symbolic link is deleted, the link becomes a dangling symbolic link. The symbolic link itself remains intact in the filesystem. It's essentially just a small file containing the path to the original file.
    
8. **Use Cases**: Symbolic links are commonly used for creating aliases, managing shared resources, simplifying directory structures, and referencing files or directories that may change location.
    
9. **Example**: Suppose you have a file named `file.txt` located in `/home/user/documents`, and you want to create a symbolic link to it in your home directory. You can create the symbolic link with the following command:
    
    `ln -s /home/user/documents/file.txt ~/file-link`
    
    This creates a symbolic link named `file-link` in your home directory that points to `file.txt`.

Symbolic links were created to overcome the limitations of hard links.
They work by creating a special type of file that contains a text pointer
to the referenced file or directory.

### Hard Links vs Soft Links

1. **Hard Links**:
    - **Usage**:
        - Hard links create additional directory entries (file names) that point directly to the inode of the original file.
        - They provide multiple access points to the same physical data on disk.
        - Changes made to any hard link are reflected in all other hard links since they all point to the same inode.
    - **Features**:
        - Cannot link directories or across filesystems.
        - Cannot link special files or device files.
        - Can be used to create backups and versioning systems where multiple links point to the same data.
        - They cannot link directories or non-regular files.
        - They don't have permissions of their own; they inherit the permissions of the original file.
        - Deleting a hard link does not affect the other hard links or the original file as long as there are still existing hard links.
2. **Symbolic Links (Soft Links)**:
    - **Usage**:
        - Symbolic links are pointers to the path of the original file or directory.
        - They act as shortcuts or aliases to the target file or directory.
        - They can link directories, files across filesystems, and non-existent files or directories.
        - Symbolic links can point to directories, special files, or regular files.
    - **Features**:
        - Can link directories, special files, and across filesystems.
        - They are more flexible but less efficient than hard links.
        - Symbolic links can be created without needing write access to the target file.
        - Changes in the original file name or location do not affect (update) symbolic links unless they are relative and the path changes.
        - Deleting a symbolic link does not affect the target file or directory.

    - Example: `[aeiouAEIOU]` matches any lowercase or uppercase vowel.
5. **Escaping Special Characters**: Some characters, such as `^`, `-`, and `]`, have special meanings within character classes. To match these characters literally, you need to escape them with a backslash `\`.
    - Example: `[-+*/]` matches any of the characters `-`, `+`, `*`, or `/`.
    - Example: `[0-9^]` matches any digit from 0 to 9 or the caret `^`.
6. **Predefined Character Classes**: Many regex engines provide shorthand notations for commonly used character classes.

	- `\xhh`: Character with hexadecimal code `hh`.
	- `\uhhhh`: Unicode character with hexadecimal code `hhhh`.
9. **Boundary Matchers**:
	1. **Word Boundary (\b)**:
	    - `\b` asserts a position where a word character (alphanumeric or underscore) is not followed or preceded by another word character.
	    - Example: `\bapple\b` matches "apple" but not "pineapple" or "apples".
	2. **Non-Word Boundary (\B)**:
	    - `\B` asserts a position where a word character is followed or preceded by another word character.
	    - Example: `\Bapple\B` matches "pineapple" but not "apple" or "apples".
	3. **String Start (\A)**:
	    - `\A` matches the start of the input string.
	    - Example: `\Aapple` matches "apple" at the very beginning of the string.
	4. **String End (\Z)**:
	    - `\Z` matches the end of the input string or before a newline at the end.
	    - Example: `apple\Z` matches "apple" at the very end of the string.
	5. **String End Before Final Line Break (\z)**:
	    - `\z` matches only at the very end of the input string.
	    - Example: `apple\z` matches "apple" only at the very end of the string, not before any newline.
10. **Flags**:
    - `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
    - `g`: Global matching (find all matches, not just the first).
    - `m`: Multi-line matching (treats beginning and end characters (^ and $) as working across multiple lines).

	- `x`: Extended mode, ignores whitespace and allows comments within the pattern.
11. **Lookahead and Lookbehind Assertions**:
	1. **Positive Lookahead (?=...)**:
	    - `(?=...)` asserts that the pattern inside the lookahead must match immediately ahead of the current position.
	    - Example: `foo(?=bar)` matches "foo" only if it is followed by "bar".
	2. **Negative Lookahead (?!...)**:
	    - `(?!...)` asserts that the pattern inside the lookahead must not match immediately ahead of the current position.
	    - Example: `foo(?!bar)` matches "foo" only if it is not followed by "bar".
	3. **Positive Lookbehind (?<=...)**:
	    - `(?<=...)` asserts that the pattern inside the lookbehind must match immediately behind the current position.
	    - Example: `(?<=foo)bar` matches "bar" only if it is preceded by "foo".
	4. **Negative Lookbehind (?<!...)**:
	    - `(?<!...)` asserts that the pattern inside the lookbehind must not match immediately behind the current position.
	    - Example: `(?<!foo)bar` matches "bar" only if it is not preceded by "foo".
	- Lookahead and lookbehind assertions allow you to specify conditions that must be satisfied ahead of or behind the current position without including them in the match.
12. **Backreferences**:
	- `\1`, `\2`, ...: Matches the same text as previously matched by a capturing group.
	- Example: `(a)\1` matches 'aa'.



### Types of Commands

- An executable program like all those files we saw in /usr/bin. Within this category, programs can be compiled binaries such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, and so on. 
- A command built into the shell itself. bash supports a number of commands internally called shell builtins. The cd command, for example, is a shell builtin. 
- A shell function. Shell functions are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment.
- An alias. Aliases are commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.


### README and Other Program Documentation Files

Many software packages installed on your system have documentation files residing in the `/usr/share/doc` directory. Most of these are stored in ordinary text format and can be viewed with the less command. Some of the files are in HTML format and can be viewed with a web browser. We may encounter some files ending with a `.gz` extension. This indicates that they have been compressed with the gzip compression program. The gzip package includes a special version of `less` called `zless` that will display the contents of gzipcompressed text files.

### File Descriptors

File descriptors are unique identifiers assigned by the operating system to open files, sockets, pipes, and other input/output (I/O) resources. These descriptors are integers that serve as references to the underlying I/O streams. Here are some key points about file descriptors:

1. **Standard File Descriptors**:
    - Unix systems typically provide three standard file descriptors:
        - Standard Input (stdin): File descriptor 0 (usually represented as STDIN_FILENO)
        - Standard Output (stdout): File descriptor 1 (usually represented as STDOUT_FILENO)
        - Standard Error (stderr): File descriptor 2 (usually represented as STDERR_FILENO)
    - These descriptors are pre-opened by the operating system for the process and are available for input/output operations.
2. **Opening Files**:
    - When a file is opened by a process, the operating system assigns it a file descriptor, typically the lowest available integer not already in use by the process.
3. **I/O Operations**:
    - File descriptors are used in system calls and library functions to perform I/O operations such as reading from or writing to files, sockets, or other I/O resources.
    - System calls like `read()`, `write()`, `open()`, `close()`, `pipe()`, and `socket()` take file descriptors as arguments.
4. **Standard Redirection**:
    - File descriptors are essential for redirection of standard input, output, and error streams. For example, the `>` and `&>` redirection operators use file descriptors to direct output to files or other streams.
5. **Limits**:
    - The number of file descriptors available to a process is limited by the system's resource limits. This limit can be modified using system calls like `ulimit` in Unix-like systems.
6. **Closing File Descriptors**:
    
    - It's important to close file descriptors when they are no longer needed to avoid resource leaks. The `close()` system call is used to close file descriptors.
7. **Duplication and Duplexing**:
    - File descriptors can be duplicated using the `dup()` or `dup2()` system calls. Duplication allows multiple file descriptors to refer to the same underlying resource, enabling more flexible I/O operations.

Duplicating file descriptors in Unix-like operating systems serves several purposes and provides flexibility in managing input/output (I/O) operations.

1. **Redirection**:
    - File descriptor duplication allows you to redirect the output of one file descriptor to another, enabling redirection of standard input, output, and error streams.
    - For example, you can duplicate standard output (stdout) to a file descriptor representing a file, a socket, or another process, allowing output to be captured or redirected.
2. **Piping**:
    - When creating pipelines in shell scripts or programs, duplicating file descriptors is necessary to establish communication channels between processes.
    - By duplicating file descriptors and connecting them to the input and output of other processes, you can create pipelines for data processing.
3. **Concurrency**:
    - In concurrent programming scenarios, duplicating file descriptors allows multiple threads or processes to access the same I/O resource without interference.
    - Each thread or process can have its own copy of the file descriptor, ensuring independent access and preventing race conditions.
4. **Resource Sharing**:
    - File descriptor duplication facilitates resource sharing between different parts of a program or between different programs.
    - For example, a parent process can duplicate file descriptors and pass them to child processes for communication or coordination.
5. **Efficiency**:
    - Duplicating file descriptors can improve the efficiency of I/O operations by avoiding the need to reopen files or sockets multiple times.
    - Once a file descriptor is duplicated, both copies refer to the same underlying resource, reducing overhead associated with resource management.

File descriptors in Unix-like operating systems are indeed manipulated using system calls such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`, and `dup()`. These system calls provide low-level access to files and other input/output resources. Here's a brief overview of each system call:

1. **`open()`**: This system call is used to open a file or create a new file if it does not exist. It returns a file descriptor that can be used for subsequent I/O operations. The prototype of `open()` is:
    
    ```c
    int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
    ```
    
2. **`read()`**: This system call is used to read data from an open file descriptor into a buffer. It reads up to a specified number of bytes from the file descriptor. The prototype of `read()` is:
    
    ```c
    ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
    ```
    
3. **`write()`**: This system call is used to write data from a buffer to an open file descriptor. It writes up to a specified number of bytes to the file descriptor. The prototype of `write()` is:
    
    ```c
    ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
    ```
    
4. **`close()`**: This system call is used to close an open file descriptor. It releases any resources associated with the file descriptor. The prototype of `close()` is:
    
    ```c
    int close(int fd);
    ```
    
5. **`dup()`**: This system call is used to duplicate an existing file descriptor. It returns a new file descriptor that refers to the same open file or resource. The prototype of `dup()` is:
    
    ```c
    int dup(int oldfd);
    ```


These system calls are fundamental for performing input/output operations, file handling, and resource management in Unix-like operating systems. They provide a low-level interface for interacting with files, sockets, pipes, and other I/O resources. Understanding how to use these system calls is essential for systems programming and low-level I/O operations in C and other languages on Unix-like platforms.

### `/dev/null`

`/dev/null` is a special device file that serves as a sink for data. It is often referred to as the "null device" or "bit bucket." The purpose of `/dev/null` is to discard any data written to it and to provide an empty source of data when read from.

1. **Discarding Output**:
    - When data is written to `/dev/null`, it is immediately discarded and not stored anywhere. This makes `/dev/null` useful for discarding unwanted output or data that is not needed.
2. **Empty Source**:
    - Reading from `/dev/null` always returns an end-of-file (EOF) condition, indicating that there is no data available. This makes `/dev/null` useful for providing an empty source of data when reading is required but no actual data is needed.
3. **Usage**:
    - `/dev/null` is commonly used in Unix-like systems for various purposes, including:
        - Discarding error messages or unwanted output from commands by redirecting them to `/dev/null`.
        - Providing empty input to commands or scripts that require input but do not need any actual data.
        - Testing and benchmarking purposes where the focus is on the performance of operations rather than data handling.
4. **Example Usage**:
    
    - Redirecting output to `/dev/null`:
        `command > /dev/null`
        
    - Redirecting both output and error to `/dev/null`:
        `command &> /dev/null`
        
    - Providing empty input from `/dev/null`:
        `cat /dev/null | command`
        
5. **Security and Permissions**:
    - `/dev/null` is a virtual device and does not correspond to any physical storage. As such, it typically has very restrictive permissions (e.g., only root may write to it) to prevent misuse or accidental data loss.

### `/dev/console`

`/dev/console` is a special file in Unix and Unix-like operating systems (like Linux) that represents the system console. The system console is the primary device used to interact with the system, especially for system administrators. It is used to display system messages, logins, and other important information, especially during the boot process and for low-level system management.

**Key Points about `/dev/console`**

1. **System Messages**: During the boot process and in the event of critical system messages, output is often directed to `/dev/console`.

2. **Primary Console**: The system console is considered the primary terminal for system administration tasks. It's typically the terminal associated with the physical keyboard and monitor attached to the machine.

3. **Access**: Only the root user or users with appropriate permissions can write to `/dev/console`.

4. **Redirecting Output**: You can redirect output to `/dev/console` to display messages directly on the system console. For example, you can use the `echo` command to send a message to the console:

    ```bash
    echo "Hello, console!" > /dev/console
    ```

5. **Security and Access Control**: Because `/dev/console` is a critical interface for system administration, access to it is usually tightly controlled to prevent unauthorized users from interacting with the system console.

6. **Device File**: Like other special files in `/dev`, `/dev/console` is a device file, which means it is an interface to a device driver that communicates with the actual hardware (the system console).

**EXAMPLE USAGE**

**Viewing Messages on the Console**

To send a message directly to the console, you can use:

```bash
echo "System maintenance starting" > /dev/console
```

This command writes the message "System maintenance starting" directly to the system console.

**Checking the Device**

To see details about the `/dev/console` device, you can use the `ls` command:

```bash
ls -l /dev/console
```

Output might look like this:

```bash
crw--w---- 1 root tty 5, 1 Aug  1 08:15 /dev/console
```

Here:
- `c` indicates that it's a character device.
- `rw--w----` indicates the permissions (read and write for the owner, and write for the group).
- `root` is the owner.
- `tty` is the group.
- `5, 1` are the major and minor device numbers.

**When `/dev/console` is Useful**

- **During Boot**: Critical messages that occur during the boot process are often directed to the console.
- **System Recovery**: In single-user mode or during system recovery, `/dev/console` is often the main interface for administrative commands.
- **Debugging**: For debugging purposes, especially when other logging facilities are not available, `/dev/console` can be used to output critical information.

Understanding `/dev/console` is crucial for system administrators who need to interact with the system at a low level, especially in environments where physical access to the machine is required.

### Users and Groups

User accounts and groups are managed through several text files located in the `/etc` directory.

1. **/etc/passwd**: This file contains information about user accounts. Each line in the file represents a user account and contains several fields separated by colons (`:`). The fields typically include:
    - Username: The login name for the user.
    - Password: An 'x' character indicating that the encrypted password is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file.
    - User ID (UID): A unique numerical identifier for the user.
    - Group ID (GID): The primary group ID for the user.
    - User information: Additional information about the user, such as the full name.
    - Home directory: The user's home directory.
    - Login shell: The default shell for the user.
2. **/etc/group**: This file contains information about groups on the system. Each line in the file represents a group and includes fields separated by colons (`:`). The fields typically include:
    - Group name: The name of the group.
    - Password: An 'x' character indicating that the encrypted password is stored in the `/etc/gshadow` file.
    - Group ID (GID): A unique numerical identifier for the group.
    - Group members: A comma-separated list of usernames that belong to the group.
3. **/etc/shadow**: This file contains encrypted password information for user accounts. It is readable only by the superuser (root) and stores the hashed passwords for user accounts, among other security-related information.
    
4. **/etc/gshadow**: This file contains encrypted password information for group accounts. Similar to `/etc/shadow`, it is readable only by the superuser and stores the hashed passwords for group accounts.

### Permissions

File permissions are organized into three categories: reading, writing, and executing. These permissions determine what actions users, groups, and others can perform on a file or directory.

1. **Reading (r)**: If a user has read permission for a file, they can read its contents using text editors, viewing commands, or file manipulation tools. For directories, read permission allows users to list the files and subdirectories it contains.
    
2. **Writing (w)**: If a user has write permission for a file, they can edit its contents, append new data, or delete the file entirely. In the case of directories, write permission allows users to create, delete, or rename files and subdirectories within the directory.
    
3. **Executing (x)**: The executing permission (`x`) applies primarily to executable files and scripts. For regular files, execute permission allows users to run the file as a program or script. For directories, execute permission allows users to access the contents of the directory, provided they have appropriate read permissions for the directory and any files or subdirectories within it. Without execute permission on a directory, users cannot access its contents even if they have read permission.


File permissions are represented in Unix systems using a symbolic notation or numeric notation:

- Symbolic notation: `r` for read, `w` for write, and `x` for execute. Permissions are represented by a series of characters such as `-rwxr-xr--`.
- Numeric notation: Each permission is assigned a numeric value. Read permission is represented by `4`, write permission by `2`, and execute permission by `1`. These values are added together to calculate the permission value. For example, read and write permission would be `6` (4 + 2).


### File Types

Various file types are distinguished by a single character at the beginning of the file listing.

- `-`: Regular file: This represents a standard file containing data, text, or program instructions. Most files on a Unix system are regular files.
    
- `d`: Directory: This indicates a directory, which is a special type of file used to organize and store other files and directories. Directories are essential for organizing the file system hierarchy.
    
- `l`: Symbolic link: Also known as a symlink, a symbolic link is a special type of file that points to another file or directory in the file system. It acts as a shortcut or reference to the target file or directory.
    
- `c`: Character device file: This represents a character device, which is a type of special file used for communication with hardware devices that transmit or receive data one character at a time. Examples include terminals, serial ports, and sound cards.
    
- `b`: Block device file: Similar to character device files, block device files are special files used for communication with hardware devices. However, block devices transmit or receive data in fixed-size blocks or chunks. Examples include hard drives, SSDs, and CD-ROM drives.
    
- `s`: Unix domain socket: This represents a special type of file used for inter-process communication (IPC) within the same host system. Unix domain sockets allow processes to communicate by sending and receiving data streams.
    
- `p`: Named pipe (FIFO): Named pipes, also known as FIFOs (First In, First Out), are special types of files used for inter-process communication between unrelated processes. They allow data to flow between processes in a similar manner to regular pipes.

### Processes

In a multitasking environment, the operating system manages multiple processes simultaneously, giving users the illusion of parallel execution. Each process represents an independent execution of a program. Here are some key points:

1. **Process Definition**: A process is an instance of a running program. It includes the program's code, memory space, open files, and other resources needed for execution.
    
2. **Process Creation**: When a user launches a program, the operating system creates a process for that program. This process is assigned a unique Process ID (PID) and is managed by the kernel.
    
3. **Kernel Role**: The kernel is the core of the operating system responsible for managing processes. It allocates resources, schedules processes for execution, and ensures each process gets its share of CPU time.
    
4. **Process States**: A process can be in one of several states, including running, waiting, and terminated. The operating system's scheduler determines which process runs at a given moment.
    
5. **Context Switching**: The rapid switching between processes is known as context switching. The kernel saves the current state of a running process and restores the state of another, allowing the illusion of simultaneous execution.
    
6. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Processes often need to communicate with each other. The operating system provides mechanisms for IPC, such as pipes, shared memory, and message passing.
    
7. **Process Termination**: A process may terminate voluntarily (e.g., reaching the end of its execution) or involuntarily (e.g., due to an error). The operating system releases the resources associated with a terminated process.

### Virtual Memory and Swapping

1. **Virtual Memory**:
    - **Definition**: Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an illusion of infinite memory to applications by allowing them to use more memory than is physically available in the system's RAM.
    - **Purpose**: It enables the operating system to allocate and manage memory resources effectively, allowing multiple processes to run concurrently without running out of physical memory.
    - **Implementation**: Virtual memory is implemented through a combination of hardware and software mechanisms. The operating system divides the virtual memory space into fixed-size pages, which are mapped to physical memory or storage.
    - **Page Replacement**: When a process accesses a page of memory that is not currently in physical memory, a page fault occurs, and the operating system retrieves the required page from secondary storage (disk) and swaps it into physical memory.
    - **Benefits**: Virtual memory allows for efficient memory utilization, supports multitasking by enabling multiple processes to share memory, and provides memory protection by isolating processes from each other.
2. **Swapping**:
    - **Definition**: Swapping is a technique used by the operating system to move entire processes or parts of processes between physical memory (RAM) and secondary storage (disk) to free up memory for other processes.
    - **Purpose**: Swapping helps prevent memory exhaustion by transferring less frequently used or inactive memory pages to disk when physical memory becomes scarce.
    - **Process**: When the operating system decides to swap out a process or memory page, it writes the contents of the memory to a swap space on disk and updates the process's page table to indicate that the memory is no longer in physical memory.
    - **Performance Impact**: Swapping can have a significant performance impact, as reading and writing to disk is much slower than accessing memory. Excessive swapping, also known as thrashing, can degrade system performance.
    - **Control**: System administrators can configure swapping behavior, such as setting swap space size and controlling swap activity, to optimize performance based on system requirements and workload characteristics.

### Terminal Devices (TTYs)

Terminal devices, commonly referred to as TTYs (Teletype Terminals), are interfaces that allow users to interact with a computer system through text-based input and output. In Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, TTYs play a crucial role in providing a user interface and facilitating communication between users and the system.
1. **Character Devices**:
    - TTYs are represented as character devices in the Unix file system (/dev).
    - They are typically named tty followed by a number or a descriptive identifier (e.g., tty1, ttyS0, pts/0).
    - Physical TTY devices can include serial ports, terminals connected via serial cables, and virtual terminals (e.g., those accessed through graphical user interfaces or remote shell sessions).
2. **Virtual Terminals**:
    - Virtual terminals are software-based TTYs that provide text-based interfaces to users.
    - Users can access virtual terminals directly from the system console or through terminal emulators within graphical environments.
    - Each virtual terminal can support a separate login session or shell session, allowing multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously.
3. **Pseudo-Terminals (PTYs)**:
    - Pseudo-terminals, also known as PTYs, are pairs of virtual character devices used for communication between processes.
    - They consist of a master and a slave device, with the master acting as a controlling terminal for applications and the slave emulating a physical terminal.
    - PTYs are commonly used for terminal emulation, remote shell sessions (e.g., SSH), and interactive command-line interfaces.
4. **Usage and Interaction**:
    - Users interact with TTYs through command-line interfaces, text editors, shell sessions, and other text-based applications.
    - TTYs provide a means for users to input commands, execute programs, view output, and receive system messages and prompts.
    - TTYs support features such as line editing, job control, and signal handling, enhancing the user experience in text-based environments.
5. **Controlling Terminal**:
    - Each process in a Unix-like system is associated with a controlling terminal, which allows it to interact with users and receive input/output from/to a terminal device.
    - The controlling terminal is essential for processes that require user interaction, enabling them to read input from the terminal, display output, and respond to user actions.

### Niceness

Nice processes, often referred to as "niceness," are a concept in Unix-like operating systems that allow users to prioritize the CPU usage of processes. The term "nice" comes from the command used to adjust the priority of processes, which is typically the `nice` command.

1. **Nice Value**:
    - Each process in Unix-like systems has a priority level associated with it, known as the nice value.
    - The nice value ranges from -20 to 19, where lower values indicate higher priority and higher values indicate lower priority.
    - The default nice value is usually 0.
2. **Adjusting Process Priority**:
    - Users can use the `nice` command to launch a process with a specific priority.
    - For example, to start a process with a lower priority (less CPU time), you can use:
        `nice -n 10 command`
        
    - Conversely, to start a process with a higher priority (more CPU time), you can use:
        `nice -n -10 command`
        
3. **Impact on CPU Usage**:
    - Processes with lower nice values (higher priority) are given more CPU time and are scheduled to run more frequently.
    - Processes with higher nice values (lower priority) are given less CPU time and are scheduled to run less frequently, allowing other processes with higher priorities to use more CPU resources.
4. **Usage**:
    - Nice processes are commonly used in scenarios where you want to run background tasks or non-urgent processes without impacting the performance of critical applications or interactive tasks.
    - For example, background tasks like file indexing, backups, or batch processing jobs can be started with higher nice values to ensure they don't interfere with the responsiveness of the system.

### Why launch a graphical program from CLI?

By launching a program from the command line, you might be able to see error messages that would otherwise be invisible if the program were launched graphically. Sometimes, a program will fail to start up when launched from the graphical menu. By launching it from the command line instead, we may see an error message that will reveal the problem. Also, some graphical programs have interesting and useful command line options.

# Administration

## Managing Users

In Linux, managing users involves creating, editing, and deleting them. These tasks can be performed using commands like `useradd`, `usermod`, and `userdel`.

---

**1. Create a User**

To create a new user, use the `useradd` command:

**Basic Syntax**:

```bash
sudo useradd <username>
```

This will create a new user with the specified username, but it may not create a home directory or set a password unless explicitly specified.

**Steps to Create a User Properly**:

1. **Create the User and Home Directory**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo useradd -m <username>
    ```
    
    - **`-m`**: Ensures that a home directory (e.g., `/home/username`) is created for the user.
2. **Set a Password for the User**: After creating the user, set their password:
    
    ```bash
    sudo passwd <username>
    ```
    
    Enter the desired password when prompted.
    
3. **Optional: Add the User to a Group**: Add the user to a specific group (e.g., `sudo` for administrative privileges):
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG <group> <username>
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG sudo john
    ```
    
    - **`-aG`**: Adds the user to the specified group without removing them from other groups.

---

**2. Edit a User**

To modify an existing user, use the `usermod` command:

**Common Modifications**:

1. **Change the User's Username**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -l <new_username> <current_username>
    ```
    
    - This changes the login name of the user.
2. **Change the User's Home Directory**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory -m <username>
    ```
    
    - **`-d`**: Specifies the new home directory.
    - **`-m`**: Moves the contents of the old home directory to the new one.
3. **Lock a User Account**: Temporarily disable a user's login:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -L <username>
    ```
    
    - **`-L`**: Locks the account.
4. **Unlock a User Account**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -U <username>
    ```
    
    - **`-U`**: Unlocks the account.
5. **Add the User to a Group**: Add a user to a specific group:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG <group> <username>
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker john
    ```
    

---

**3. Delete a User**

To remove a user, use the `userdel` command:

**Basic Syntax**:

```bash
sudo userdel <username>
```

This removes the user but **does not delete their home directory** or files.

**Remove User and Their Home Directory**:

If you also want to delete the user's home directory and mail spool:

```bash
sudo userdel -r <username>
```

- **`-r`**: Deletes the user's home directory and files in `/var/spool/mail/`.

**Force Remove a Logged-In User**:

If the user is currently logged in, you may need to force the removal:

```bash
sudo userdel -f <username>
```

---

**4. Examples**

1. **Create a User with a Home Directory and Password**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo useradd -m john
    sudo passwd john
    ```
    
2. **Add a User to the `sudo` Group**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG sudo john
    ```
    
3. **Delete a User and Their Home Directory**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo userdel -r john
    ```
    

---

**5. Check Existing Users**

To see all users on the system, check the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

Each line corresponds to a user, with the first field being the username.

---

**Best Practices**

- Avoid using the root account for daily tasks; instead, create a non-root user with administrative privileges (`sudo` group).
- Use strong passwords for all user accounts.
- Lock unused or inactive accounts to enhance security:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -L <username>
    ```

4. **/etc**: Stores system-wide configuration files. Configuration files for system services, network settings, user authentication, and other system configurations are stored here.

5. **/home**: Contains user home directories. Each user has a separate subdirectory in /home where they can store their personal files and configurations.

6. **/lib** and **/lib64**: Contains shared libraries (dynamic link libraries) that are used by executable binaries and other libraries. /lib is used for 32-bit libraries, while /lib64 is used for 64-bit libraries on systems with a multilib architecture.

7. **/media** and **/mnt**: Mount points for removable media devices such as USB drives, external hard drives, and optical discs. /media is typically used for automatic mounting by desktop environments, while /mnt is used for manual mounting by users or system administrators.

8. **/opt**: Contains optional application software packages that are installed manually and are not managed by the system package manager. Some third-party software packages may be installed in /opt.

9. **/proc**: A virtual filesystem that provides information about system processes and kernel parameters in real-time. It contains directories and files that represent running processes, system resources, and kernel configuration settings.

10. **/root**: The home directory for the root user (superuser). Unlike regular users who have their home directories in /home, the root user's home directory is located at /root.

11. **/sbin**: Contains essential system binaries (programs) that are used for system administration tasks. These binaries are typically meant for use by the root user and perform critical system tasks.

12. **/srv**: Contains data for services provided by the system. This directory is typically used for files that are served by the system, such as websites, FTP files, and version control repositories.

13. **/sys**: A virtual filesystem that exposes information about kernel objects, device drivers, and kernel configuration parameters. It is similar to /proc but focuses on the kernel's runtime state and hardware configuration.

14. **/tmp**: A directory for temporary files. Users and applications can store temporary files here, which are typically deleted upon system reboot or when no longer needed.

15. **/usr**: Contains user-accessible files and directories that are not required for system booting or repairing. It is further divided into subdirectories like /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/include, /usr/share, etc., which contain binaries, libraries, header files, and shared data files used by applications and users.

   ```

2. **search** — Shortcut for grep to search text with filtering:
   ```
   alias search='grep'
   ```

3. **update** — Runs system update and upgrade commands in one shortcut:
   ```
   alias update='apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y'
   ```

4. **count** — Counts the number of files in the current directory and subdirectories:
   ```
   alias count='find . -type f | wc -l'
   ```

# Background

### GNU vs Unix vs Linux

Understanding the differences between GNU, Linux, and Unix involves delving into the history and roles of each term within the context of computing and operating systems. Here's a breakdown:

**What is Unix?**

Unix is a powerful, multi-user, multitasking operating system originally developed in the early 1970s at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. It was designed to provide a simple, clean design that could be implemented on inexpensive hardware. Unix has been influential in the development of computer science and is widely regarded as the foundation upon which many modern operating systems are built.
	**Key Characteristics:**
	- **Multi-User:** Designed to allow multiple users to work simultaneously on the same machine.
	- **Multitasking:** Supports running multiple processes concurrently.
	- **Text-Based Interface:** Primarily uses text-based interfaces, though graphical user interfaces (GUIs) became more prevalent later.
	- **Command-Line Tools:** Comes with a rich set of command-line tools for file management, text processing, and system administration.

**What is GNU?**

GNU is a free software replacement for the components of the Unix operating system. The GNU Project, initiated by Richard Stallman in 1983, aimed to develop a sufficient body of free software to get along without any software that is not free. The name "GNU" is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix."
	**Key Components:**
	- **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):** A suite of compilers for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D languages.
	- **GNU Core Utilities:** A core set of Unix utilities like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, etc., rewritten to be compliant with the GNU GPL.
	- **GNU Bash:** A popular shell and scripting language.
	- **Libraries and Tools:** Numerous libraries and tools that complement Unix functionality.

**What is Linux?**

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel, first created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It was inspired by the Unix operating system and aims to be POSIX-compliant. Linux serves as the core of the most popular open-source operating systems, including Android, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu, among others.
	**Key Characteristics:**
	- **Kernel:** The heart of the operating system, managing hardware resources and providing an interface for user space applications.
	- **POSIX Compliance:** Strives to adhere to the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard, ensuring compatibility with Unix applications.
	- **Modularity:** Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy customization and extension.
	- **Community Support:** Supported by a vast global community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to its continuous improvement.

**Summarized**

- **Unix** is the original operating system that laid the groundwork for modern computing concepts like multitasking and multi-user systems. It's proprietary and commercialized by various vendors.
- **GNU** is a project focused on creating a free software alternative to Unix, providing a wide range of tools and libraries that mimic Unix's functionality.
- **Linux** is an operating system kernel that implements Unix-like functionality on top of the Linux kernel. It's open-source and forms the basis of numerous Linux distributions, which include GNU tools and applications to provide a complete Unix-like environment.

### GNU

The GNU Project, led by Richard Stallman, aims to create a comprehensive, free software replacement for the entire Unix operating system. Over the years, it has developed a wide array of tools and software that are integral to many Unix-like operating systems today. Below is a comprehensive overview of some of the top GNU software and tools, highlighting their purpose and significance.

**GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**

- **Purpose:** The GCC is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. It is a key component of the GNU toolchain.
- **Significance:** It allows developers to compile and link their own programs, making it a fundamental tool for developing free software.

**GNU Bash**

- **Purpose:** Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language. It incorporates interactive command execution, script execution, variable substitution, filename wildcarding, command line editing, job control, shell functions, and aliases.
- **Significance:** It is the default shell for most Unix-like systems and is widely used for scripting.

**GNU Core Utilities**

- **Purpose:** These are the basic tools supplied with most Unix-like operating systems, including `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`, `grep`, `find`, etc.
- **Significance:** They form the backbone of Unix/Linux command-line operations, enabling users to manage files, directories, and processes efficiently.

**GNU Emacs**

- **Purpose:** Emacs is an extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor—and more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.
- **Significance:** It is renowned for its powerful editing capabilities and the vast array of plugins available, making it suitable for everything from coding to writing documents.

**GNU Binutils**

- **Purpose:** Binutils is a collection of binary tools. The main ones are the linker (`ld`) and assembler (`as`). There are also several other tools included, such as `objcopy`, `objdump`, `strip`, and `readelf`.
- **Significance:** These tools are essential for linking object files into executable binaries and for manipulating and inspecting those binaries.

**GNU Make**

- **Purpose:** Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
- **Significance:** It simplifies the build process, automating the compilation of large projects by determining which pieces need to be recompiled and issuing the commands to recompile them.

**GNU Libc**

- **Purpose:** The GNU C Library, glibc, provides the system calls and basic functions like `printf`, `malloc`, `exit`, etc., that are used by nearly every program on a Linux system.
- **Significance:** It is central to the Linux operating system, providing the critical APIs needed for software to interact with the operating system.

**GNU Octave**

- **Purpose:** Octave is a high-level programming language primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a command-line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments.
- **Significance:** It is especially suited for engineering and scientific applications and is compatible with MATLAB.

**GNU Guile**

- **Purpose:** Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, packaged for use as a scripting language for the GNU system. It supports embedding Scheme code in C programs.
- **Significance:** It enables the creation of powerful, flexible scripts and extends the capabilities of GNU software.

**GNU Gnash**

- **Purpose:** Gnash is a free Flash player. It supports playing SWF files and can be used as a browser plugin or standalone application.
- **Significance:** Before HTML5 became widely supported, Gnash provided an alternative to Adobe's Flash Player.

**GNU Hurd**

- **Purpose:** The Hurd is an operating system kernel designed to be a safe, fast, and reliable replacement for the Mach microkernel. It is part of the GNU operating system.
- **Significance:** While still under development, the Hurd aims to address some of the scalability and security issues found in monolithic kernels.

### POSIX

The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command-line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems. It is intended to make it easier to write portable software that can run on any POSIX-compliant operating system.

**Key Components of POSIX**

- **API:** POSIX specifies a standard API for accessing system resources, including input/output, data streams, and mathematical functions. This ensures that programs written for one POSIX-compliant system can run on another without modification.
  
- **Shell and Utilities:** POSIX defines a standard set of command-line utilities (such as `ls`, `grep`, `awk`, etc.) and a shell (sh) that these utilities can be used with. This standardization makes it easier for users to switch between different Unix-like operating systems.

- **Regular Expressions:** POSIX defines a standard syntax for regular expressions, which is used by many of the utilities for pattern matching.

- **Threads:** POSIX defines a standard for threading, allowing for concurrent execution of code within a single program. This is crucial for developing efficient, scalable applications.

**Importance of POSIX**

- **Portability:** Perhaps the most significant advantage of POSIX is its emphasis on portability. By adhering to the POSIX standards, software developers can write programs that run consistently across different operating systems, reducing the need for separate codebases for different platforms.

- **Interoperability:** POSIX standards promote interoperability between different systems and applications. This means that software written for one POSIX-compliant system can often be used on another without modification.

- **Consistency:** POSIX provides a consistent interface to system resources and functionalities across different operating systems. This consistency reduces the learning curve for developers moving between different Unix-like systems.

**POSIX Compliance**

Not all operating systems are fully POSIX-compliant, although many strive to be. Linux, for example, is largely POSIX-compliant, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a portable solution. Other operating systems, like macOS and Windows, have varying degrees of compliance, offering subsets of POSIX functionality.

### C Standard Libraries

When it comes to C standard libraries on Linux, **GNU C Library (glibc)** and **musl** are two prominent options, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

#### GNU C Library (glibc)

- **Widely Used**: Glibc is the most common C library on Linux systems, used by major distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian. It has extensive support for various features and is well-integrated into the Linux ecosystem.

- **Feature-Rich**: Glibc includes many GNU-specific extensions and features that enhance compatibility with a wide range of applications. This makes it suitable for complex software that relies on these extensions.

- **Performance**: While glibc is optimized for performance, it can be heavier in terms of resource usage compared to musl. This is due to its extensive feature set and backward compatibility.

- **Compatibility**: Glibc is designed to be backward compatible, which means that older applications are likely to run without issues on newer versions of the library.

#### Musl

- **Lightweight**: Musl is designed to be a lightweight and simple alternative to glibc. It aims to provide a clean and efficient implementation of the C standard library, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

- **Standards Compliance**: Musl is known for its strict adherence to standards, which can lead to better portability across different systems. However, this strictness means that some GNU extensions available in glibc may not be present in musl, potentially causing compatibility issues with certain applications.

- **Performance**: Musl is often faster and uses less memory than glibc, making it a good choice for applications where performance and resource usage are critical.

- **Use Cases**: Musl is commonly used in lightweight Linux distributions like Alpine Linux, which is popular for containerized applications due to its small size and efficiency.

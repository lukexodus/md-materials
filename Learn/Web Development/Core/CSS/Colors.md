# RGB Patterns

There are several patterns you can use to make educated guesses about RGB color values:

## Brightness/Luminosity
- **High values across all channels** (200-255, 200-255, 200-255) → light colors, approaching white
- **Low values across all channels** (0-50, 0-50, 0-50) → dark colors, approaching black
- **Mid-range values** (100-150 range) → medium brightness

## Dominant Channel
- **Red dominant** (255, low, low) → red hues
- **Green dominant** (low, 255, low) → green hues  
- **Blue dominant** (low, low, 255) → blue hues

## Equal or Similar Values
- **All three equal** (128, 128, 128) → pure gray (no color/hue)
- **All three similar** → desaturated colors, grayish tones

## Two Channels High
- **Red + Green high, Blue low** (255, 255, 0) → yellow
- **Red + Blue high, Green low** (255, 0, 255) → magenta/purple
- **Green + Blue high, Red low** (0, 255, 255) → cyan

## Saturation Patterns
- **One channel maxed, others at 0** → pure, saturated color
- **Channels closer together in value** → less saturated, more muted
- **Large gap between highest and lowest** → more vivid/saturated

## Common Examples
- (255, 0, 0) = pure red
- (0, 255, 0) = pure green  
- (0, 0, 255) = pure blue
- (255, 255, 255) = white
- (0, 0, 0) = black
- (255, 165, 0) = orange (red high, green medium, blue low)
- (128, 0, 128) = purple (red and blue equal, green absent)

The more you practice, the better you'll get at estimating colors from their RGB values!

## Roles of each file type in SvelteKit:

1. +page.svelte:
    - This is the main component file for a page route.
    - Contains the HTML template, script section (JavaScript), and style section.
    - Used for client-side rendering and interactivity.

2. +page.js:
    - Runs on both server and client side.
    - Used for client-side JavaScript logic that needs to run in the browser.
    - Can be used for dynamic client-side operations.

3. +page.server.js:
    - Runs only on the server side.
    - Used for server-side data fetching and processing.
    - Ideal for handling sensitive operations like API calls with credentials.

4. +layout.svelte:
    - Similar to +page.svelte, but applies to all child routes under this layout.
    - Used for shared layout structure across multiple pages.

5. +layout.js:
    - Runs on both server and client side for layouts.
    - Similar to +page.js but for layouts.

6. +layout.server.js:
    - Runs only on the server side for layouts.
    - Similar to +page.server.js but for layouts.

Key connections:

1. The .svelte files (+page.svelte, +layout.svelte) contain the component logic and templates.
2. The .js files (+page.js, +layout.js) contain client-side JavaScript logic.
3. The .server.js files (+page.server.js, +layout.server.js) contain server-side logic.

Best practices:

1. Use +page.svelte for the main component structure and client-side interactivity.
2. Use +page.server.js for data fetching and operations that should only run on the server.
3. Use +page.js for client-side logic that needs to run in both development and production environments.
4. Use layouts (+layout.svelte, +layout.js, +layout.server.js) for shared structures across multiple pages.

# ITIL Service Lifecycle Terms

## Service Strategy

- **Service Strategy** - The lifecycle stage that defines the perspective, position, plans, and patterns that a service provider needs to execute to meet business outcomes
- **Service Portfolio Management** - Managing the entire lifecycle of all services, including the service pipeline (proposed/in development), service catalogue (live), and retired services
- **Financial Management for IT Services** - Managing budgeting, accounting, and charging requirements for IT services
- **Demand Management** - Understanding and influencing customer demand for services and provisioning capacity to meet these demands
- **Business Relationship Management** - Maintaining positive relationships with customers, identifying their needs, and ensuring services deliver value
- **Strategy Management for IT Services** - Defining and maintaining the service provider's perspective, position, plans, and patterns for strategy development

## Service Design

- **Service Design** - The lifecycle stage focused on designing IT services, including architecture, processes, policies, and documentation
- **Service Catalogue Management** - Managing information about all live IT services, ensuring availability to authorized users
- **Service Level Management** - Negotiating, defining, documenting, agreeing, monitoring, and reporting on service levels
- **Capacity Management** - Ensuring IT capacity meets current and future business requirements in a cost-effective manner
- **Availability Management** - Ensuring services deliver agreed levels of availability to meet business needs
- **IT Service Continuity Management** - Managing risks that could seriously impact IT services, ensuring recovery within required timeframes
- **Information Security Management** - Aligning IT security with business security and ensuring information security in all services and activities
- **Supplier Management** - Obtaining value for money from suppliers and ensuring they meet contractual commitments

## Service Transition

- **Service Transition** - The lifecycle stage managing the introduction of new or changed services into operational use
- **Transition Planning and Support** - Planning and coordinating resources to deploy a major release within predicted cost, quality, and time estimates
- **Change Management** - Controlling the lifecycle of all changes to minimize disruption while enabling beneficial changes
- **Service Asset and Configuration Management** - Maintaining information about configuration items (CIs) required to deliver services, including their relationships
- **Release and Deployment Management** - Planning, scheduling, and controlling the build, test, and deployment of releases
- **Service Validation and Testing** - Ensuring releases create expected value and don't introduce unacceptable risks
- **Change Evaluation** - Assessing major changes before authorization, evaluating intended and unintended effects
- **Knowledge Management** - Sharing perspectives, ideas, experience, and information at the right time to enable informed decisions

## Service Operation

- **Service Operation** - The lifecycle stage coordinating and carrying out activities and processes to deliver and support services at agreed levels
- **Event Management** - Managing events throughout their lifecycle to detect, escalate, and respond appropriately
- **Incident Management** - Restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible and minimizing adverse impact on business operations
- **Request Fulfillment** - Managing the lifecycle of all service requests from users
- **Problem Management** - Managing the lifecycle of all problems to prevent incidents from happening and minimize impact of unavoidable incidents
- **Access Management** - Granting authorized users the right to use a service while preventing access to non-authorized users

## Service Lifecycle Functions

- **Service Desk** - The single point of contact between the service provider and users for day-to-day activities
- **Technical Management** - Providing technical skills and resources needed to support the IT infrastructure
- **Application Management** - Managing applications throughout their lifecycle, responsible for managing applications as IT services
- **IT Operations Management** - Managing ongoing IT service delivery and support activities (includes IT Operations Control and Facilities Management)

## Cross-Lifecycle Concepts

- **Continual Service Improvement (CSI)** - Aligning and realigning IT services to changing business needs by identifying and implementing improvements to services and processes supporting them
- **Service** - A means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve without ownership of specific costs and risks
- **Service Management** - A set of specialized organizational capabilities for providing value to customers in the form of services
- **Process** - A structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective, taking defined inputs and turning them into defined outputs
- **Function** - A team or group of people and tools they use to carry out one or more processes or activities

## Key Correlations

**Sequential Flow**: The lifecycle stages follow a logical sequence (Strategy → Design → Transition → Operation) with CSI providing feedback loops throughout.

**Strategy-Design Correlation**: Service Strategy outputs (service portfolio, financial requirements) become inputs for Service Design processes.

**Design-Transition Correlation**: Service Design Packages created during Design are handed over to Transition for implementation. Service Validation and Testing verifies designs meet requirements.

**Transition-Operation Correlation**: Release and Deployment Management transitions services into the operational environment where Service Operation processes manage them day-to-day.

**Operation-Strategy Correlation**: Operational metrics and incident/problem data inform strategic decisions about service improvements and new service development.

**CSI Integration**: Continual Service Improvement spans all lifecycle stages, using data from Service Operation, identifying improvement opportunities, and feeding back into Strategy and Design.

**Shared Processes**: Some processes span multiple stages (e.g., Capacity Management operates in Design and Operation; Knowledge Management operates across all stages).

**Configuration Management**: Service Asset and Configuration Management in Transition maintains the CMDB used by all other lifecycle stages for accurate service information.
